She wrote a nice piece on where oil‚Äôs place in the WFPB diet that is really sound logic. 

Of course everyone will have their opinion and choose their level of strictness for what they allow. 

Anyway enjoy the read and the recipe for fancy toast that she includes

8,r59uc9,PlantBasedDiet,"  I started a WFPB diet a month ago after I watched a lot of interviews with dr Barnard, dr Klaper, dr McDougall and I believe in their message, it makes a lot of sense. But since being on the low carb/keto bandwagon for a year I sometimes still hear the mantra 'carbs are the devil'. It doesn't help that I feel bloated, but still hungry, constantly thinking of food, I just feel like I am losing control.

Currently I feel like I am gaining weight, my hunger is insane, even though I eat till I feel full mostly vegetables, fruits, mushrooms, with a side of carbs, without nuts, oils, bread, pasta, sugar etc. As fats, I eat a tbsp of chia seeds, flax or pumpkin seeds.

I know it is too soon to expect to see results, it's only been a month, but to be honest I am terrified of gaining back weight. I still have at least 20kg more to lose to be considered  normal weight which is what I want. 

A (lot) of backstory: I have struggled with my weight all my life, I have been yo-yo dieting (from 45kg to my highest 98 kg in early 2020). That's when I started with low carb and intermittent fasting, transitioned to alternate day fasting and a vegetarian diet, still keeping pretty low carb. I lost 20kg in this time, but my weightloss has hit a plateau for almost 5 months and now I am constantly losing and regaining 3-5kg. Started going to a gym, working out for 1.5h to 2h 4-5 times a week. Not much improvement weight wise, or measurements, just an increase in strength. 

I decided to go WFPB which seems like the natural next step. I started this new lifestyle in late october. I also decided to stop alternate day fasting for now because I don't think i can manage to eat so many calories from a WFPB diet with no oil, low in fat. I eat a lot of veggies, mushroom, fruits, but I have a food intolerance which prohibits me to eat cashews, almonds and most tree nuts.

If you have any advice, reassurances, success stories, or not so successful ones, send them my way, they will be appreciated. Thanks for reading my long ass post.",Ex - low carb in need of advice

My sister and brother-in-law eat a whole food, plant based diet. However, my husband does not. Last year for Thanksgiving we hosted at my house. I had a lot of fun picking out new recipes and preparing a meal. It was 100% plant based. We have a rule at my house between my husband and I, that no matter what the other person cooks, you have to eat it. So if he cooks, I eat it or if I cook, he has to eat it. This made last year‚Äôs Thanksgiving enjoyable to me (maybe not so much to my husband) because I did all the cooking. I would say that we had a lovely dinner.

Also I need to note is that my husband is on the thin side. He has struggled for a long time to gain weight. He typically eats sweet potatoes and whole milk to try to bulk up (in opposition to eating junk food). He also weight lifts. Still he struggles to bulk up. He wants to consume animal protein to help with his weight gain. He is also from a culture where many traditional dishes are made with meat so it is also his comfort food. 

Fast forward to today and my sister is hosting this year. In the past, when we have visited my sister, it has been all plant based. This bothers my husband because he feels that when they visit us, we take a lot of time and consideration into making a meal they would like and he doesn‚Äôt feel that that is being reciprocated. If he brings his own meat dish, my sister won‚Äôt let him use any of her plates or silverware because the meat will ‚Äúcontaminate‚Äù them. This makes my husband feel disrespected, like he‚Äôs being treated like ‚Äúgerms‚Äù.

I had layered veggies on the trays, but I might try another batch today in a baking dish where I can add a little water and a lid so there is some moisture. Get stuff cooked through, then take the lid off for the final roasting/browning part. 

Or was an air fryer a bad idea? Anyone got tips here? Thanks!",Using an air fryer?

136,qtqm1o,PlantBasedDiet,"10 years ago, at my fitness peak, I went from a Mediterranean style diet to a WFPB diet. Didn't ease into it, just went for it. The 8 months I was on WFPB were the best I ever felt, the most energy I ever had. Sadly, my situation at the time made a Mediterranean diet much easier to manage and went back to it. 

Fast forward to 2020, I have been plagued with depression, IBS, Iatal Hernia, oesophagus ulcers from chronic reflux, and a few month ago, I landed in the hospital with acute pancreatitis. After reading on how to heal my pancreas, turns out meat fats are my enemy. So, 3 weeks ago, I went back to WFPB.

On the 3rd day, I was energetic the fog in my head was gone, I was physically able to sustain physical activity again. 3 weeks later, I have been working out 5 days a week, I am able to take on projects, I am upbeat. But through the whole diet change process, which I didn't ease into, I never once felt abdominal discomfort, lack of energy or any of the bad effects I should be feeling according to academic reviews.

I still have 2 vices; I drink 1-2 cappuccino daily and I smoke 1 cigarette daily. The latter which I entend to cut completely in the next few weeks. The former much harder since I love the taste of coffee so much.

So I would like to ask others who are on WFPB:

- Is this type of diet sustainable in long term? Specifically I am using Thrive as a guide, are there other good (or better) sources out there?  

- Do I have to forego coffee completely on this type of diet?

- Do I need to supplement? Is there specific supplements to provide what this type of diet might be lower in?

- What is the catch? Why do I feel so good from literally just changing overnight and don't have any negative effects, is this gonna last or is the bad going to catch up to me eventually?",WFPB experience and questions.

I eat about 7 grams of ALA in two smoothies (33g of flax each time) and the rest of the ALA comes from kale and other foods.

Seeing as how people commonly consume more than 10g of almonds at a time in snacks, almond butter, or as almond flour; I'd bet &gt;10g (say like eating 1/4 a cup or 1/2 cup) of almonds would probably par right up with 30.9g of flax (or surpass it) in terms of cyanide influence.

It's free and I just want some feedback so I could improve and make this accessible and useful for many others in the plant-based community.

After more than a year of development and many more before that idealising and thinking of how I can make it work to help me stay on top of my nutrition while living a busy life, I created an online app which generates plant-based meal plans automatically based on your personal fitness goals and nutritional requirements with the aim to save time and take the guess work out of healthy plant based nutrition. I figured if I would find it useful, perhaps others will too so I decided to make it a public project.

211,qnn6ke,PlantBasedDiet,"How Not to Die says eating berries can blunt the insulin spike from \[other\] high-glycemic foods (referencing: [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23365108/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23365108/)), hence my question: In order for food to be healthy, must the fiber and micronutrients come structurally intact with the same whole food that offers the calories, or could one get away with mixing them in extracted forms? For example, if you hypothetically extracted the sugar from an apple, would eating both the extracted sugar and the remaining sugar-less apple (simultaneously) be roughly as healthy as eating the structurally intact apple prior to the extraction, or would the latter be significantly healthier because its sugars are structurally bound to the fiber or micronutrients in some significant manner? And if the latter, how exactly does the structural integrity prevent the harmful effects of refined sugars/calories?

The practical implications of this question have to do with the safety of adding refined sugars to very high-fiber foods to increase their palatability. I understand that date sugar is the healthiest sweetener (followed by blackstrap molasses and probably jam), whole food is always better than refined food, it's fine to add a little sweetener if it helps you eat a healthy food you otherwise wouldn't, yada yada. I also realize this question is a very complex way of saying I have a sweet tooth &gt;\_&gt;, but nonetheless I think it's very important even just as an academic question.

I couldn't find any food that he didn't react to so I started making it for him myself after consulting with a veterinary nutritionist and finding the right recipe/macro ratio/vitamins and supplements -- he ended up doing the best on the PB recipes and now it's been three years!  He is a senior dog now but is in excellent health, no skin issues (unless he eats something off the ground) and kidneys/liver have normal levels which were previously always elevated.

I don't weigh my food or really want to keep track of my protein intake exactly however, I would like to make sure that I don't lose muscle mass and having given up animal proteins I want to make sure I'm eating enough plant based protein.

I know it's possible to saute without oil. I do it often. I also know that my wife screams at me when i saute ingredients that go into a pot of beans to make this been stew. I now use her favorite large pan and I didn't use oil in it for some time.

3 table spoons of oil in 6 quarts works out to be 1/8 of the tablespoon per cup or 15 calories of oil per cup.

This started with concern about rising LDL (bad) cholesterol levels and that has turned around (20% drop). And there are so many other benefits. Benefits to self and to the planet.

While it is often a challenge to eat out and find vegan options, there always seems to be something that works even if it is just a couple of side orders. I confess to still missing the taste of a few non-vegan foods, mostly cheeses, but the substitutes work out well enough for me. I have lots to learn to be a decent vegan cook but that will come with more practice.

I supplement daily with Omega 3 and a multi-vitamin. The multi has B-12 but my level has dropped and needs to be dealt with. While it seems that my diet does not include enough calcium, blood work says that is ok. Actually all is good except the B-12. The supplement says it has 667% of the RDA for B-12 but, apparently I need more.

I am fortunate that friends and family are very accommodating of my diet choices. Only one of my friends is vegan. With friends and family, we work it out if our time together includes eating.

362,qf8e8b,PlantBasedDiet,"Hello all :]

I've been interested in plant based milks for a while and decided to try cashew milk, as I've heard almond milk was pretty watery and I was afraid it would put me off. I bought Silk unsweetened cashew milk, and I was surprised - I love it! Now since it's a whole ass carton of cashew milk and cashews are hella expensive I know that there can't be a heavy ratio of cashews to water and whatever preservatives are added to make it shelf stable for this price. I also noticed it has kind of an aftertaste, though it's not too bad.

I'm wondering if homemade cashew milk also has a problem with an aftertaste at the sacrifice of losing the shelf stability. All the recipes I'm looking up say that it's only good in the fridge for about three days, so I'm wondering if having a higher ratio of cashews to water would fix the aftertaste problem.

371,qdygr7,PlantBasedDiet,"For the past month and a half, I've been going through the process of switching to a WFPB diet. My father recently had a scheduled bypass surgery and there's a lot of heart disease in my family, and I want to take control of my health. Also, I've been increasingly uncomfortable about my cognitive dissonance of identifying as an animal lover yet still eating animal products. 

So far, the diet switch has gone quite well. I have much more energy and have experienced a notable lack of anxiety and fearfulness since starting this diet. I have eaten animal products 3-4 times over the past 6 weeks, but when I thought about doing it a few days ago when I was at a restaurant with poor vegan options, I was grossed out by the idea of animal products and chose to eat a weird vegan option instead. Unfortunately, I also suspect I have issues with gluten as well. In the spirit of brevity I won't go too much into it but I think I will need to have a gluten-free diet as well. 

So, onto my issue. Eating out is a big part of my life. My partner and I are fortunate enough to be able to dine out rather frequently. I live in a part of the U.S. where it is extremely easy to find vegan, gluten-free options wherever I go (though I have accepted that I will eat oil when I eat out; this is not a huge deal to me because I don't have any preexisting health conditions as of yet). However, we also travel quite a bit. In the past, we have celebrated big occasions at Michelin star restaurants, and we have traveled internationally fairly extensively. When (if?) the pandemic is finally under control, we will travel again. In the past, we have made food a central part of our trips. We love exploring a culture through its cuisine, and we typically order many different dishes and share everything. I mourn the loss of this social aspect. 

At home, I do the cooking. I have been meal-prepping quantities of chicken to add to his portion of the WFPB gluten-free meals I've made, and he's more than happy with that. He also recently purchased a grill, and he can learn to cook meat for himself to add to the meals I make. As recently as a few days ago, I thought that I would simply make exceptions to my diet when we go to a fancy restaurant that has a prix fixe menu without vegan options, or when we travel and there are no good options. I figured, a gluten-free diet *has* to be strict, because even a little bit can set off a months-long autoimmune response. But I could eat small amounts of animal products a few times a year without too much detriment to my overall health. 

However, the further I've gone down this path, the more I can't escape the fact that it is against my morals to eat animal products. I've done more research into the matter and I can't unknow what I've learned. I am starting to believe veganism is the only acceptable path for me. I think this is genuinely going to be a relationship hurdle for my partner and I when we travel again. He is a bit of a hedonist and just wants to live the ""good"" life and consume whatever he pleases. I'm sure he would feel better on a WFPB diet, but he doesn't suffer the same ill health symptoms I do; he can eat and drink to his heart's content and feel mostly good. 

I am not going to try to convince him to change his eating habits in any way. I believe the best way to lead is by example, so maybe he will alter his habits and ask questions if he sees my (hopeful) success on this way of eating. But if he doesn't, I won't push the point. He is very willful and will most certainly react to any pressure by doubling down on his position. Plus, I just don't feel that anyone else's consumption is my business. 

Is there anyone who has navigated a similar situation or can offer any advice? The main destination in my mind about this issue is Japan. The last time we were there, we ate ramen, sushi, Izakaya fare (lots of meat and dishes containing soy sauce, which unfortunately contains gluten), curries (usually not vegan and probably containing flour), and burgers. It's his favorite place in the world, and one of mine as well, and eating out is going to be a huge hassle for me, and by extension, for him. I wish he were more supportive but I also understand the annoyance that comes with having to alter a peak experience for yourself because of someone else's choices. I'm thinking this may, in some circumstances, come down to a choice between eating gluten (bad for my health) or animals (against my morals). I am asking for advice and insight here instead of r/vegan because I don't believe I would get any nuanced or empathetic responses over there.",Advice on navigating the switch to a WFPB and gluten-free diet with an omnivore partner?

I still looked up a lot of recipes and ideas so this weekend I plan on meal prepping and really trying to get serious about it. I recently learned my cholesterol is high, I have an elevated liver enzyme, I was put on blood pressure meds - not to mention the 70 pounds I have to lose. I really thought all of this would be enough to motivate me, and it did for awhile, but not enough. I have tried changing the way I eat on and off for years so I have become very, veeerry well-acquainted with my weak areas and downfalls. One of them is striving for perfection or nothing at all. So I've caught myself overthinking again.  

I am not a veggie person. Everyone's food pictures of fresh veggies and salads look so good and I want to like it too, but I just can't. I will eat green beans. I have no problem cramming a few cups of greens into a smoothie, so I've got that going for me. I can tolerate quite a few veggies if they're super soft in a stew or soup form. And of course, the starchier the veggie, the more I'm ok with it. 

I'm drawn to a lot of the black bean/sweet potato dishes, pastas with hidden veggie sauces, other whole grain meals. I do continue to try vegetables cooked in several ways but I will start gagging after a few bites. I will add onions, sweet peppers, etc. to things and I think I'm in the mindset of those not really counting as anything. Only the good green stuff matters. This all becomes very discouraging as I feel like my diet shouldn't consist of mostly grains, starches and legumes. However, again, I know I will fail if I don't like the food I'm eating. I also know that even if I start out with the meals I've listed it's still better than the alternatives I would be turning to. 

Am I wrong in some of my opinions? I'm still researching the ""rules"" of this way of eating. Should I not be worrying about this as much as I am? Will I be just fine with fruits, pastas, and massive green smoothies and vegetable stews? I of course will keep trying with the fresh veggies and hopefully my taste buds will adjust.",Food Balance

However, I‚Äôm allergic to tree nuts. I avoid peanuts because I had a cross contamination reaction once. I also have to be careful about some seeds, especially ‚Äúbulk bin‚Äù type seeds since cross contamination is very high (and it‚Äôs hard to distinguish a sliver of almond from sunflower seeds when it‚Äôs all mixed up). I have anaphylactic type allergies to nuts, carry an Epi-pen, and I simply cannot budge or bend on eating nuts.

Being nut-free and vegan isn‚Äôt difficult in my day to day life. But I find *a lot* of WFPB recipes, meal ideas, and diet guides rely on nuts. 

**What are some nutrients that are vital in nuts that I‚Äôm missing out on?**

I can eat flax and hemp seeds. I don‚Äôt like the taste but I can learn to like them. I love sesame seeds and eat a lot of tahini. I haven‚Äôt tried chia seeds and sometimes new foods worry me because of my allergies.

I've seen doctors (9 of them). They've confirmed I don't have celiac or any inflammatory condition. They suggest less fiber, but I don't understand how that's possible without eating dead animals, boosting calorie density with sugar and oil, or eating at an calorie deficit which isn't sustainable as I don't have weight to lose.

Sorry if thats a stupid question.
A few weeks ago I wrote a feedback comment to a vegan restaurant which makes plantbased handcrafted meals that seem relatively healthy.
I've eaten there a few times and I like their products but at home I only cook WFPB. I basically wrote them that I like their products but that they would be even better if they move more towards a WFPB direction.
They replied to me and basically agreed. They wrote that they ""process pressed oils only very sparingly and use only fresh, unprocessed raw materials.
Deep-frying, for example, is a no-no, but baking eggplant without oil is hardly feasible and leads to unconvincing results.""

And then they asked if I have any feedback for a specific product. 
I was thinking I could suggest that they make their hummus oil-free and, ideally, with not that much tahini so that it is low-fat. If they arent satisfied with how creamy the hummus turns out, they could consider skinning their cooked chickpeas to make the hummus more creamy, although that would require extra time and effort.
They also use a cashew-dressing &amp; a ginger-miso-dressing in some recipes. I could also suggest that, if its not already the case, they make those dressings without oils.

But other than that I cant think of much.
They use a vegan version of nutella, which I kind of dont dare to criticize because I cant suggest a WFPB alternative that seems feasible and affordable for a small company like that.

&gt;Oatmilk (water, oats), low erucic acid rapeseed oil. Contains 2% or less of: dipotassium phosphate, calcium carbonate, tricalcium phosphate, sea salt, dicalcium phosphate, DHA algal oil, sodium ascorbate (antioxidant), tocopherols (antioxidant), riboflavin, vitamin A, vitamin D2, vitamin B12.

The second ingredient ""low reucic acid rapeseed oil"" or in the US often called canola oil, makes a big impact.  Oats are 15% fat by calories food, hence it's milk should be the same.  Yet:

* 1 cup FF Oatly
* Calories - 160
* Fat - 9 g = 81 calories

If the drink were purely oats, one would expect 15% fat from calories, about 24 in this case but here it's 81 from the canola oil, making this a 50.6% fat by calories product.  Since the oat calories only compromise 79 calories, the oat fats tally to 12 calories and 69 will be canola oil, a little more than half a tablespoon in each cup.

In wfpb accepted milks, you will expect to find macros roughly similar to their host food (almonds to almond milk, say) except the subtraction of most fiber.

550,pyhp2v,PlantBasedDiet,"2016. I was eating anything and everything, no matter the animal, no matter the source. My options were diverse, but so were internal problems that were facing me. Cystic acne, lethargy, anxiety were all crippling me. Until one day, I had to temporarily stop eating dairy as I was on acne antibiotics. Little did I know that this was a blessing in disguise! I had more energy and was feeling a lot less lethargic; very much like increasing the video quality of a YouTube video! Within 2 years, I made the transition to plant based eating and I haven‚Äôt looked back since! Here are some of the benefits that I‚Äôve harnessed with plant based eating.

**Better physical performance:** Being a sports and fitness fan, the differences in my performances before and after this diet is like night and day. My endurance has increased tenfold, I feel stronger and I am a lot more injury free. This is because dairy and meat products can increase inflammation in the body and joints, leaving us more susceptible to injury. Also, I am better able to recover from gym sessions and playing football matches and I suspect this is a direct result of there being less inflammation in my body. It‚Äôs not just me, some of the best sports athletes in the world such as Lewis Hamilton and Virat Kohli all follow plant based diets.

**Greater focus:** As I feel less tired and lethargic in the morning, it has helped to stay more focused throughout the day even without the help of coffee. As a result, I am better able to focus on work tasks and I complete them to a higher standard.

**Greater sense of well being:** Overall, I just feel a greater sense of lightness within myself. According to studies, meat products are harder to digest and can lead to constipation. However, with a plant based diet, you‚Äôll be getting more than enough fibre to ensure that this will never be a problem! With this lightness, I feel like I am more sensitive to food, as if my taste buds have become enhanced, better allowing me to enjoy the wide ranges of scrumptious plant based food that are available to me!

Transitioning to a plant based diet does not have to be immediate! Start by trying plant based options at restaurants, or having one plant based meal a week. The proof is in the pudding and I wholeheartedly encourage everyone to find out for themselves about these benefits! For it is truly accessible to everyone!

Now to add to the list of things I don't have to worry about are - finding potential bones/tendons/hard parts/weird body part chunks in my food (even fking meat burger patties would consistently have some hard/chewy disgusting parts); much less need to worry about food being undercooked or the particularly awful parasites found in meat/fish; no need to look into the whole diet/lifestyle of the animal to determine whether they are really grassfed, how much stress they have, if they get any hormone or antibiotic injections, etc. to determine if their dairy has good nutritional composition.

**LDL:** Seems like most vegans float around 40-60-ish     
**HDL:** Seems like most vegans float around 60-80-ish     
**Triglycerides:** seems like most vegans float around 50-60-ish

But there are studies Gregor himself points to that show that eating things like blue berries and spinach before even the unhealthiest high fat McDonald‚Äôs meal can almost completely mitigate biological markers for artery damage or whatever. There are compounds in meat like certain omega 6 fats that are associated with great health benefits that cannot be found at all in plant foods.

If you can avoid stuff like added hormones and other unnatural processing of these foods I think there is insufficient evidence to say that adding them to you diet in small amounts in conjunction with protective foods would come with significant health risks. I think it‚Äôs also somewhat dishonest to say that eating a whole food plant based diet comes with no draw backs. A lot of these foods are hard to digest, contain anti nutrients, and things like oxalates which come with known health risks. I‚Äôm not knocking eating this way.

I am very new to a plant based diet. My partner &amp; I recently made the switch &amp; we are both really enjoying it so far. My only issue is that my period is now MIA.

I have booked a doctors appointment but it‚Äôs not for ages due to the NHS backlog. I was wondering if any of you guys have experience this when you first made the transition. I will admit that before making the change I did consume a lot of semi-skimmed milk due to having a huge coffee addiction. I am thinking that maybe my body is confused by the lack of all the hormones that are found in cows milk. I am not with child (have tested twice just to be absolutely sure &amp; I am also someone who has been told by doctors that I will need IVF to conceive so I knew when testing it would be highly unlikely that I would get anything other than a negative result)

I've come across some interesting things you can do to boost nutrition for various foods and I'm on the search for more that I haven't heard of yet. Thought I'd share what I've come across, see if ya'll can contribute any, and then I'll make some sort of list/graphic to share once I compile them all.   


Here's what I've got so far:  


* Pre-chop cruciferous vegetables to boost sulforaphane production
   * Sulforaphane is a beneficial phytonutrient found in cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, brussels sprouts, kale, collards, or cauliflower). Sulforaphane is created via a reaction triggered by chopping the vegetable. To maximize sulforaphane production, chop cruciferous vegetables 40 minutes before cooking. If frozen, this strategy will not work, but you can still boost sulforaphane production by adding some mustard powder to trigger the reaction.
   * Reference: [https://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/09/how-to-cook-broccoli/](https://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/09/how-to-cook-broccoli/)
* Pre-chop or crush garlic to boost artery relaxing compounds
   * Garlic creates artery relaxing compounds via a reaction triggered by cutting or crushing it. To maximize production of these compounds, cut or crush the garlic ten minutes before cooking it.
   * Reference: [https://nutritionfacts.org/video/flashback-friday-inhibiting-platelet-activation-with-garlic-onions/](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/flashback-friday-inhibiting-platelet-activation-with-garlic-onions/)
* Black pepper boosts turmeric absorption
   * Adding black pepper to dishes containing turmeric can boost the absorption of the turmeric phytonutrient curcumin by 2000%.

I stumbled upon this great subreddit when I was looking to drastically change my diet up.

I ended up at about 130kg (286lbs) at 6"" and was dreadfully unhealthy. The whole keto/carnivore/lowcarb/justeatbacon method wasn't working and it was just an excuse to eat like a pig. So, the good news is that in a month im down 5kg and I've noticed a few things:

1. inflammation. it's gone! I used to blame those pesky carbs for bloating me up but looks like it was the meat. any links to this?
2. mood. I am calm, focused and have balanced energy. I seemed to live on the edge with constant anxiety whilst on a meat based diet - is this a drop in cortisol and a boost in serotonin from the carbs?
3. No bloating. what is going on? I assume that all these lovely plants have done wonders for my gut as I feel lighter and healthier. I'm gonna take a punt and say fibre! why is this wonderful nutrient ignored so much?

My dad is a lifelong smoker and drinker, went to an ENT-specialist yesterday after antibiotics didn't clear up throat pain and they found some masses there that could be bad. 

He already has trouble eating because of the throat pain. My mom is on nutritional drinks because her MS makes eating hard (also zero appetite) and my dad is now taking them too to just get some cals in. I've moved in temporarily to help out (also with cooking), I switched to plant based a while ago and I told them that while I'm happy to cook, since I'm making the meals it's gonna be plant based. Problem is, I don't have a lot of experience cooking foods that will not aggravate a sore throat.

I joined a gym solely for the purpose of gaining muscle. This is a privately owned gym which does all forms of training. On the first day, the owner and operator who is also a trainer, talked to me. **BEFORE** he asked me what I eat, have any allergies or what my eating regimen was, he gave me a run down of things to **completely** get rid of in my diet. I thought it was pretty strange, because, other than sugar, I have never heard any of the other claims. Then he emailed me that information so I can reference it. I talked to my family doctor - who knows my health very well - and she said his nutrition guide sounded like alarmist bullshit. 

He says in order to gain muscle, you have to get rid of Soy, Dairy, Sugar, Gluten and Corn. 

Why? Because it makes your muscles inflamed. And inflamed muscles slow your gains progress. That was the jist of it.

Inverse associations were observed between the intake of apples and pears, citrus fruits, green leafy vegetables, cruciferous vegetables, and salads and cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality, and between the intake of green-yellow vegetables and cruciferous vegetables and total cancer risk.

993,p6bl4g,PlantBasedDiet," The idea is to follow a daily high-protein goal and weekly calorie goal (21,000 kcal). This should be easy after following a daily ""shell"", constant staple foods, of about 100 g protein (including 40 g protein powder) and 1500 calories. This way, all one needs to do is count the calories and protein from lunch and dinner (instead of everything every day). Why? This is for weight-gain and bodybuilding. 

By ""shell"" I mean a morning snack, afternoon snack, evening snack and drinks. 

* 600 calorie breakfast
   * 20 g protein
* Ideally, 275 calorie peanut butter apple, morning snack
   * 7.5 g
* lunch
* Ideally, 250 calories 1/4 cup almonds + 7 apricot halves, afternoon snack
* dinner
* Ideally, 380 calories 1/2 cup walnut/ pecan night snack
   * 14.5 g (including almonds+apricots from the afternoon) 

600+275+250+380

\~= 1500 kcal

Drinks

* ~~120 OJ, 1 cup~~
* 250 soymilk, 2.5 cups
   * 17.5 g protein
* ~~150 grape juice, 1 cup~~
* ~~130 vanilla protein powder, 1 serving~~
* ~~150 chocolate protein powder, 1 serving~~

By only using the foods accepted on a WFPB diet, the shell equals 1750 calories and 59.5 g protein (vs 2300 calories and 102.5 g protein). So 550 calories and 43 g protein difference from the juice and protein powder. 

For a 3000 calorie, 160 g protein diet, this would mean lunch and dinner would have to be an average of 625 calories each. It's possible, but challenging to get that many calories (excluding the drink). 

Say one's daily protein goal is 160 g. That means, a 29 g protein average for each lunch and dinner would have to be bumped up to \~**50 g** protein per meal. Now that's a stretch. Most meals are 10-30 g protein. 

# Solutions

‚Üí larger breakfast (e.g., 1444 calorie smoothie)

‚Üí sip some blended drink throughout the day: for example, a 30 g protein soy milk perhaps with quinoa blended together

‚Üí different/larger morning, afternoon and evening snacks equaling 52 g protein total

‚Üí \~2 cups of soymilk more for breakfast and \~2 cups more for dinner (or lunch)

After the WFPB high-protein high-calorie shell is figured out, I'll try to make one for nut free, soy free, gluten free, keto friendly and maybe IBS friendly.

Hello there, im excited as i just met this subreddit a few hours and have been looking at posts very motivated.

From what i was able to rescue, im planning on buying the books Eat for Health and How not to die.

The issue is my habit and mentality when cooking, my mind is very structured and i always have hard time cooking unless i know all the details (for example if i dont know if i have to boil the water for 5 minutes or 8 minutes, i kind of collapse).

Thats why i found a way of life that works for me, as im trying my best to be independent. This is making a ‚Äúlife manual‚Äù. So here i will be filling things like amount of items to buy each week, where to buy them, which meals i know how to cook, etc.

So the reasons of me coming here today are two: 
1) i want to get better and have a healthier lifestyle, as i have ulcerative colitis, migraines and bipolars type I.

2) I want to ask the community for some guidance. The only way for me to learn, is by being a geek as i always am :) that means trying to optimize everything. My dream would be to have a resource that teaches me specifically how to cook in one day for the whole week, teaching the method of how to do the processes in parallel, and the very details including the minimal ones on the meal cooking itself.

I believe that a resource like this will motivate me a lot, because the ups and downs of everyday life sometimes make it hard to keep a daily routine of cooking. I know this about myself, and have been in that place where i barely take care of myself and end up skipping meals, which triggers a whole lot of other negative symptoms

Anything that i missed please let me know, at the moment i can‚Äôt think of more details of what i need, and this is very important to me as its the last step needed to become independent in my life.",New here! Looking for specific resources (look inside)

Recipe:

3.  Portion out and microwave a portion for 3 minutes.
4.  Store the rest in the refrigerator.

The Chinese cabbage in this dish is So so so Tender and naturally sweet, paired with Shiitake mushroom, the strong, earthy, and umami flavor.

1075,p1hcvu,PlantBasedDiet,"I am the oddball in the family who chose to explore different diets. I never felt particular great from eating the ‚Äúamazing‚Äù food my heavily white pasta, animal balls, and dairy family ate.
It always seemed...weird. We all got together but ate what people kept claiming is amazing ... and then we were so damaged from it we all literally needed to run home to sleep it off.
But what hurt worse is that... I quickly realized I was ostracized by so many by wanting to I show up but just not out myself into a food coma.

At first I had to make excuses. Then I just gave up and began eating and telling others I changed for health, because they would never just leave it alone. I was called rude. I was told sleeping is a sign of it being so good the body needed to process it. I was yelled at . People literally caried I wouldn‚Äôt eat bacon ...and when I began vomiting from them sneaking it into my food I was being dramatic. 

Anyway. I switched diets. And I just began getting my life back. Food actually energized me. I felt good after eating. I could use the bathroom without a 30 min push session . I didn‚Äôt need to pop pills to get me through the day. 

A lot has happened in my life. But I was hanging with a decently good family member. I was willing to eat their non meat food . Just white pasta with police oil and fried eggplant . 

I just can‚Äôt believe how badly it made me feel. I walked into the house feeling good. I left with a wave of fatigue , headache coming on. I had to bail hanging out with a friend because I needed to vomit.

The other person I ate with immediately went to sleep after. But they claim that has nothing to do with the food. They are in denial.

I‚Äôm just shocked . I can‚Äôt believe how badly I use to feel. How did I live like that ? How does anyone have a life feeling like that all the time ?",I can‚Äôt believe I felt that bad before

I recently saw a doctor for the first time in *years* for some other issues, and in the process she brought up ""oh you haven't had a blood panel in 20 years and you're nearing 40 years old? Let's do that!""

The initial tests, Comprehensive Metabolic Panel and Complete Blood Count, came back all within range save for my blood glucose which came in at 108mg/dl, with a 65-99 the desired range. I did some looking into it and attributed it to my morning coffee that day, the initial CMP and CBC weren't fasting blood tests, so naturally I had my normal routine cup of coffee getting ready that day. At the doctor's recommendation to verify that glucose is fine, I followed up with a fasting A1c test and Lipid Panel and was just *blown away* with the results! The doctor sent me a message with my results ""keep up the good work!"" Very satisfying and validating to hear that, to *know* I'm doing the right thing.

I knew eating this way made me feel good, I'd heard the science and peer-reviewed studies from Dr. Greger - I love watching his videos, sometimes I'll put them on to relax and get ready to sleep - but I hadn't actually... put it to the (blood) test, unnntil now!

&gt; Hemoglobin A1c 4.7
    
I had a separate blood pressure read the day before the A1c and Lipid tests, and that came in at 113/71. That was actually a little *high* for me, as my past 3 reads over the previous 12 months have been 105/63, 109/58, and 104/65. Regardless, it's still a great place to be! I attribute it to having been on vacation for a week and not getting my 10k steps in every single day, spending more time experimenting with my new waffle maker, making tons of banana oat waffles and hash browns. Gotta treat yourself every now and then!

Beans and quinoa and vegetables every single day, cooked at home. Flax and chia and black cumin once a day in a glass of water before meal. 2-4 tbsp unsalted sunflower kernels. Usually for dessert a banana or three, an apple, and often a grapefruit, though sometimes I make nice cream from frozen bananas, sometimes oatmeal banana cookies, cinnamon apples, all sorts of tasty treats!

I wish somebody had told me about this lifestyle sooner. I wish *more people knew about it!* To think of all the preventable diseases and pains and heartache caused by eating the Standard American Diet, to see it all around us all the time, to *know* what salt and sugar and oil and meat and dairy do to our bodies and to have everyone around us *willfully* indulging despite the risks... it's madness.

Fiber is your friend, don't toss it out! Wall off your calories, eat plants whose cell walls have to be broken down to access the goodies inside, don't eat a bunch of processed vegan junk food, imitation meats and smoothies.

üëâ INGREDIENTS (Makes 3 ¬Ω Cups)

¬Ω large (1¬Ω- to 2 lb) head cauliflower, broken into florets  
2 teaspoons vegan butter (soy-free if  
necessary)  
8 ounces cremini mushrooms (or button mushrooms), sliced  
2 teaspoons liquid aminos (or gluten- free tamari; use coconut aminos to be soy-free)  
¬Ω cup raw cashews (if you don‚Äôt have a high-speed blender, soak in warm water for at least 30 minutes and drain; discard the water)

2 tablespoons nutritional yeast  
1 tablespoon arrowroot powder (or cornstarch)  
1 teaspoon dried thyme  
¬Ω teaspoon garlic powder  
¬Ω teaspoon salt

üëâ HOW TO DO

Place the cauliflower in a steamer basket over a pot of boiling water and cover. Steam the cauliflower until tender, 7 to 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and liquid aminos and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Remove from the heat.

Combine the steamed cauliflower, cashews, milk, nutritional yeast, arrowroot powder, thyme, garlic powder, and salt in a blender and blend until smooth.

Lower weight, little to no inflammation (huge improvement!), and all my numbers were in the normal range. Yay! My doctor was very impressed.

However my LDL Cholesterol, for the first time in my life was a bit high. The note claims that LDL should be under 100, and mine was exactly 100. I know I'm doing nearly everything I can just by being WFPB and exercising, but is there anything I can do to bring this down? I don't eat sugar or white flour, and eat exclusively PB with some tofu and gardenburgers my only deviation on occasion. I usually do four hours a week of ashtanga yoga as well, but am currently nursing a strained hamstring so taking a month or so off.

I am mostly worried about this because when I was pregnant with my son I had borderline gestational diabetes, and was told that this can be a warning sign of being predisposed to Type 2 Diabetes in older age. I'm 44 currently.

1255,oohdyu,PlantBasedDiet,"So basically my entire life I‚Äôve been eating like a carnivore. In my culture, we eat lots of meat. Since I was born my family would eat lots of meat, and I was raised on meat. My dad ate tons of meat and his daddy did before him. We did eats lots of wild meats like moose, rabbit, deer, fish, even beaver and things like that, but I haven‚Äôt been able to do this for some time now. I never feel my hunger is satisfied unless I get some meat, and I‚Äôve been having to buy all my meat from grocery stores and can‚Äôt afford to ensure I‚Äôm getting all my meat from ethical  sources. I feel bad because they treat those animals terribly and their lives are suffering, I don‚Äôt want to support that and we can‚Äôt be killing them cows and piggies and shit so much, especially if all they know is suffering and torture. Because of this, I want to cut back my meat consumption until I‚Äôm a position where I can hunt my own meat again, and also I want to reduce my probably massive risk of heart disease.

1266,onsv30,PlantBasedDiet,"Right now, I‚Äôm reading How Not to Die, and I like the approachability of the book and the research behind it, but am finding some interpretations of the data and context around it a bit too editorialized and sensational for my taste, particularly around things like industry funding and the drug industry. While I believe diet is an important part of my personal health and well-being (why else would I be here?), I want to use it in conjunction with - *not* as a replacement for - the minimal medications I‚Äôm currently on. I have anxiety, depression, and panic disorder, and I am aware of the side effects of my antidepressant. It‚Äôs been life-saving and life changing for me, and even if I would be considered an exception, consuming more media that suggests I could have remedied this with natural methods doesn‚Äôt sit well with me. I suffered for so long unnecessarily because of the stigma against medication, and I‚Äôd like to avoid more of that messaging, as I do not see the benefits of coming off my antidepressant ever outweighing the significant pain and suffering I know is on the other side without it. It helps me stay stable and off more addictive and dangerous medication, and makes it possible for me to live a normal life.

I‚Äôve noticed this trend among natural and green spaces in general - for example, it is difficult to find zero-waste toothpaste that incorporates fluoride. Yes, I am aware of corporate interests, funding, and lobbying - I don‚Äôt need or want reminders to ‚Äúfollow the money‚Äù and check my sources, though I do appreciate knowing where study funding came from and digging into study design on my own.

Are there any books on this subject that are a bit less editorialized in their approach to reviewing the studies?

Although I was never super strict about what I ate (I was/am 100% plant-based though), my diet gradually started getting worse, i.e. I started eating more and more junk food, and eating a lesser variety of food types.

[https://joinzoe.com/post/expert-webinar-calories-do-they-really-count](https://joinzoe.com/post/expert-webinar-calories-do-they-really-count)
&gt;
&gt; Figures on food labels tell us nothing about other important factors, such as the structure of the food (the food matrix), how the food was processed, and any interactions between nutrients.
&gt;
&gt; For example, [grinding or chopping almonds affects their food matrix](https://joinzoe.com/post/are-nuts-bad-for-you-why-the-calorie-counts-for-almonds-dont-add-up) and allows us to absorb more calories from them than from the same amount of whole nuts. Similarly, finely ground oatmeal causes less healthy blood sugar spikes than larger oatmeal pieces.
&gt;
&gt; Calories also don‚Äôt tell us anything about the quality of the food we‚Äôre eating. A hundred calories of candy is very different in nutritional terms from a hundred calories of nuts or kale.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; ‚ÄúIn my opinion, the back of pack labelling or the nutrient composition and the calories, only tells us one piece of a thousand-piece puzzle,‚Äù Sarah says.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Food is complicated but humans are complicated too, and many factors affect our response to food, from our genetics and body shape to our microbiome and sleep patterns.
&gt;
&gt; Our PREDICT studies show that [even identical twins can have very different responses to the same foods](https://joinzoe.com/post/nature-medicine-predict-1). And identical twins can [gain different amounts of weight](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejm199005243222101) in response to overeating by the same amount.

&gt; If you transplant the gut microbiota from an obese mouse üêÅ into a thin mouse üêÅ, and keep the diet exactly the same (same food &amp; calories), the thin mouse will become obese. WHAT?!? üò≥

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5082693/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5082693/)
&gt;
&gt; A link between obesity and the gut microbiota was initially suggested based on studies in germ-free mice. These mice are raised in a sterile environment and have no microorganisms in their gut. Conventionally reared mice have a 40% higher body fat content and 47% higher gonadal fat content than germ-free mice even though they consume less food than their germ-free counterparts. Furthermore, when the distal gut microbiota from the normal mice was transplanted into the gnotobiotic mice, there was a 60% increase in body fat within 2 weeks without any increase in food consumption or obvious differences in energy expenditure suggesting that the gut microbiota affects phenotypic characteristics related to obesity of the host. Mechanistic studies revealed that the transplanted microbiota not only increased caloric release from dietary plant polysaccharides, but also modulated host genes that affect energy deposition in adipocytes including fasting-induced adipocyte factor (Fiaf). Fiaf is a circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibitor and its suppression is essential for the microbiota-induced deposition of triglycerides in adipocytes. These findings suggest that the presence of a gut microbial community may affect the amount of energy that is extracted from the diet and thus the adiposity of the host.

&amp;nbsp;

I bet that's gotta settle all kinda arguments (on both sides that is) after all these years.

A calorie is really is JUST a calorie, if and only if we human beings weren't consuming it.

Once we've ingested something, our gut bacteria will determine what's gonna happen next.

Simply put, eat minimally processed foods (i.e. let's just keep it simple and stick with boiling / chopping / cutting / dicing / steaming etc. in order to avoid unnecessary or excessive changes that are applied to the food matrix) while feeding our friendly gut bacteria with plenty of fiber.

While I love the idea of WFPB diet and I've lost 45 lbs now mostly using a rough WFPB approach some of the rules seem confusing.

Biggest confusion comes from the no oils approach and/or the no juices.

And even based on the ""whole food"" - no ""hyperprocessed foods""...this all seems very subjective and lacking in any measurable qualifications.

I originally looked at a post where people were questioning oils/mayo used in a post and if the ""followed the rules"" but the rabbit hole only gets deeper when I traced how olives are processed...OYVEY!

see:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oStoeHntfG8

1360,oic5nh,PlantBasedDiet,"This speaks to the ""whole food"" aspect of this group.

&gt; UPFs are essentially industrial formulations mostly or entirely made from industrial ingredients, with little or no whole foods. They often contain substances not used in home cooking, especially the additives for sensory properties of food ([3](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.600449/full#B3)). Typical UPFs include carbonated beverages, bagged snacks, mass-produced packaged bread and buns, and ice cream.    
&gt;  
&gt; UPF producers prioritize taste, cost, storage, and stability during transport, whereas neglecting nutritional quality ([6](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.600449/full#B6)). UPFs are common in the western dietary pattern and generally rich in total fat, saturated fat, added sugar, and salt, whereas poor in fiber and vitamin density ([7](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.600449/full#B7), [8](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.600449/full#B8)), which is detrimental to mental health ([9](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.600449/full#B9), [10](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.600449/full#B10)).   
&gt;  
&gt;Discussion  
&gt;  
&gt;In this study, we found UPF consumption was positively associated with depressive symptoms in US adults. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, health behaviors, and chronic disease, participants whose UPF contributed more than 73% of total energy intake had a 35% higher risk of depressive symptoms compared with whose UPF contributed &lt;34% of total energy intake.

1364,oi2ws7,PlantBasedDiet,"Hello plant based community!

I‚Äôm Dan, developer of [The Scientific Meal Planner](https://scientificmealplanner.com/), and I‚Äôve just launched a major update!

If you haven‚Äôt heard about it yet, this is a tool which utilizes the latest nutrition science to generate extremely healthy meal plans. You‚Äôre probably aware that science points towards a whole food plant based diet being optimal for health and longevity. This tool reflects that reality. 

It generates meal plans that attempt to satisfy [nutritionfacts.org‚Äôs Daily Dozen foods](https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2018/03/metric.png) you should incorporate into your diet daily. Every day in the meal plan satisfies a minimum of 75% of the Daily Dozen servings, something that is really difficult to plan out yourself manually.   
It also has a lot of options you can layer on top. For example, you can generate a meal plan where:

* Every day satisfies at least 75% of the Daily Dozen
* Every day has 1700-2000 calories
* All recipes take 30 minutes or less
* It doesn‚Äôt contain foods you don‚Äôt like or are allergic to 

The big addition in this update is [The Daily Dozen Recipe Browser](https://scientificmealplanner.com/recipes/browse). This lets you browse all recipes in the site, filtering by which daily dozen groups they contain, and other filters that let you find something that matches your tastes. The idea being you can use this whenever you‚Äôre just looking for a one-off recipe, and not an entire meal plan. It‚Äôs freely accessible, no log in or payment required, but premium users get additional filters.  
The other big change is that I made the tough call to remove the totally free version of the meal planner. If you‚Äôve been following the project, you‚Äôd know that I‚Äôve been struggling with balancing my desire for this to help people eat healthy and the financial realities of spending my time working on this. Originally the site was 100% free, to then adding a premium option, to now the latest evolution which is getting rid of the free version.

I still want it to be as accessible as possible, so I‚Äôve introduced a cheaper, yearly plan that comes out to $4.99/mo. It has a 14 day free trial now too. I wrote a blog post about my reasoning for this change [here](https://scientificmealplanner.com/blog/the-road-to-sustainability).   
I think this change will help get the project to a more sustainable place where I can continue development indefinitely. My vision for The Scientific Meal Planner is to continuously improve it as new science becomes available, honing the meal planning algorithm to produce the best evidence based meal plans for health and longevity. [Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm currently working on](https://trello.com/b/UQkPED8a/the-scientific-meal-planner).

I hope you‚Äôll consider supporting the project! Or if you just want to find some healthy recipes, check out the [Daily Dozen Recipe Browser for free](https://scientificmealplanner.com/recipes/browse), forever.

The reason I say ""mostly"" is a lot of times my husband ends up getting stuck with ""nothing to eat"" syndrome and we end up going out and getting a pizza. Okay once in a while but we have been doing it too often.

I love meal planning and cooking and do the meals each week for my husband and I. He loves my dinners but I think it's the in between times, like making a quick lunch or needing a late night ""fourth meal"" where he gets stuck. I am simple and don't care about making a meal out of an avocado on toast or a bowl of oatmeal. He is the type of person who wants something DELICIOUS for every meal and I really only have the time for cooking three or four meals a week.

So, I guess I am asking for suggestions for...

1) really filling plant based meals I can make every single week that are good leftover

2) filling, quick lunches that can be made in five minutes or less

3) any good pantry recipes that are delicious to make for when there is truly ""nothing to eat"" in our fridge","Husband always complaining we have ""nothing to eat"" or the food isn't filling. Suggestions?"

1391,ognxy6,PlantBasedDiet,"I've been vegan for 3.5 years and following a (mostly) WFPB diet for about three. 

I thought the beans smelled funny when I soaked them but nobody else thought they did, so I went ahead and cooked them. I don't heavily season my beans and thought they tasted a bit off, but again, nobody else noticed. That makes sense because they took their portion of the beans and added a bunch of other stuff that would heavily mask the flavor.

I should've trusted the gut feeling I had and stopped eating them after the first bite but I regrettably finished the bowl. About three days later, I opened the jar they were stored in and there was a horrid odor in them, very pungent and a bit moldy even though I didn't see any mold. They had probably been in an early-ish stage of rot when I cooked and ate them.

Anyway, the night of eating them, I let off the damn worst fart I've ever produced in my life. The amount of gas wasn't unusual or excessive. I didn't have any other issues, like cramping or diarrhea. It was just a god awful fart, heavy *and* lingering. It was the first of many over the next two weeks until I caught on.

That's pretty much what has happened every time I eat legumes. I've eaten pinto beans my whole life and in the past few years greatly increased black bean, chickpea, kidney bean, and lentil consumption. I've eaten all of those without issue for years now, even the day before the spoiled pinto beans. They have never done anything remotely close to this to me. Doesn't matter if they're canned, soaked before cooking, cooked extra long, whatever, they cause this problem now. The only exceptions seem to be peanuts and tofu.

I avoid split green peas and navy beans because they will give me bad gas and I avoid whole wheat for the same reason; the effects of those foods are nothing, and I mean nothing close to this. Nothing else in my diet appears to be an issue. Brassica vegetables, peppers, allium, corn, potatoes, oats, quinoa, mushrooms, fruit, nuts, and seeds, pretty much everything else... I can still eat without issue.

I cut legumes out entirely for a few weeks and now have them every once in a while to see if the issue has resolved itself. It hasn't. I love legumes, so even though there are tons of other plants to fill their space nutrition-wise, I will greatly miss the flavor and comfort they (used to) bring me if I can't have them again.

I'm willing to do a stool test if necessary but all of those things seem to be fairly pricey and I'd like to maybe try some other suggestions, if any, before resorting to that.

First, EPA and DHA may compete for residency in membrane phospholipids and thereby differentially displace n-6 PUFAs, which are highly prevalent in the Western diet. This would influence biosynthesis of downstream metabolites of inflammation initiation and resolution. Second, EPA and DHA exert different effects on plasma membrane biophysical structure, creating an additional layer of competition between the fatty acids in controlling signaling. Third, DHA regulates membrane EPA levels by lowering its rate of conversion to EPA‚Äôs elongation product n-3 docosapentaenoic acid.""

1423,of6lo6,PlantBasedDiet,"Since the pandemic started 1.5 years ago I‚Äôve been stuck in a small village in a country where there are absolutely no processed vegan foods available, so eating WFPB has been extremely easy (and has made me feel amazing). However, because I was stuck somewhere, I was daydreaming for WELL over a year about all the crazy delicious vegan junk food I would let myself splurge on when I‚Äôd be able to travel to a place with these kinds of foods. 

Well, I‚Äôve finally just arrived in America, and I just spent an obscene amount of money at a vegan cafe: Cesar salad with bacon, a fried chicken parmesan sub with mozzarella, and a free side of Mac and cheese (obligatory: yes all vegan). I had about one bite of each before a very powerful wave of nausea came over me and I had to stop. I was actually shocked, because I used to be able to eat these kinds of foods incredibly easily. But now I barely managed a few bites of something I‚Äôd be dreaming about for ages; and it was a complete waste of money which bums me out. I‚Äôm bleak. 

Now all I can think about is how amazing I‚Äôd feel if I‚Äôd just had some beans and vegetables. And how much ******* money I‚Äôd have saved, too. 

It really is true: the longer you are on this lifestyle, the nastier processed junk becomes. It‚Äôs a bummer that I obviously still crave it, but the physical feeling after eating it is horrible. I drove home wondering if I was going to puke in the car.

1434,oesbu0,PlantBasedDiet,"So I know that Folic acid is the synthetic form of Folate. It's not possible to overdose on natural Folate, but it is possible to overdose on synthetic Folic Acid. According to Chronometer I get over 1000 mcg of Folate/Folic Acid which is above the UL, but all of it is the natural Folate form found in food so I don't worry about it.

My question is: If I were to take a vegan supplement that contained synthetic Folic Acid, would I be in danger of overdosing on Folic Acid since I already exceed the UL with my natural Folate intake? Would me taking Folic Acid whilst consuming large amounts of Folate cause any problems or does the body process these two chemicals differently?

The reason I'm asking is because I'm a college student so I need to find cheap and reliable ways to get Iodine (I don't want to use seaweed or iodised salt) and B12 into my diet. I'm considering using the Vegan Society's VEG 1 supplement because it comes in large bottles and is very cheap so a single bottle will last me a long time. The problem is, VEG1 contains 200 mcg of Folic Acid, meaning that if I took it daily I would be getting over 1200 mcg of Folate/Folic Acid from my diet and the supplement.

1520,o8q12g,PlantBasedDiet,"TLDR: Unfournately, I still rely on parents for money, so I asked mother to buy V-B12 supplement. Refused when I said I'll take it weekly. 

Unfortunately, I still live with my parents (18M, just graduated) and do not have a job (still looking), so I am reliant on my parents for financial support. I don't like them (or my family), but I don't have a choice.

So I asked my mother to buy a Vitamin B-12 supplement for me. 

[It was this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00C43H9KU/). It has 100 tablets that each contain 5000 mcg. 

I thought it would be the best one, since 

* it costs around $9 and lasts around 2 years.
* I would take one tablet at the beginning of each week (it's recommended for vegans to take a weekly supplement of 2500 mcg; you can't overdose on vitamin B-12), so it's more ""low-maintenance"" (I'll just need to buy a new one every 2 years).  
* it seems to be free of any animal products

I looked for others that offered 2500 mcg tablets, but they had lower ""weeks it will last"" to ""cost"" ratios. 

My mother, on the other hand, refused to buy it and told me that taking a supplement weekly was ""too dangerous,"" and that I should take one daily instead (I assume because she is unfamiliar with someone taking weekly supplements).

I explained to my mother that, despite what the bottle indicates, I could take one weekly, that I couldn't overdose on it (better safe than sorry if I already have B-12 deficiency), and that a weekly approach wouldn't be any more harmful than a daily one. It was simply a matter of personal preference. 

I preferred a weekly approach because it was more low-maintenance (meaning I take a pill each Monday and forget about it for the rest of the week), but my older sister (who misunderstood what the fuck I said) said that my health was not ""low-maintenance."" with the air that I wasn't taking my health seriously. 

My mother also doubted my claim that a daily 250 mcg supplement would be necessary (I said 250 mcg due to the 1.5 +1% rule) because she found recommended daily dose is 2.4 mcg (despite the fact that no 2.4 mcg supplements fucking exist). I tried to explain that your body only absorbs what it needs.

But then she went on to say that because I ""dragged myself into this"" (despite the fact that I was vegan before I told her), I should take my health seriously (despite the fact that I done my research and am more knowledgeable about this than she is) and that I shouldn't take any shortcuts (despite the fact that taking the easier path and compromising my health isn't mutually exclusive). Needless to say, it was pretty frustrating.

1550,o6nt4g,PlantBasedDiet,"Hello all,

I have been vegan for almost a year now, and I have loved every minute of it. My life has improved in a myriad of ways, and I was able to lose ~100 lbs from my previously obese state. A WFPB diet played a significant role in helping me to cut the weight and alleviate other health issues, and I was largely committed to the cause for quite a good while.

However, over the past month or so, I have unfortunately diverged from my dedication to WFPB and have fallen into the trap of divulging on more processed vegan foods. I started a new job that demanded much more on-site time, and I began to opt for convenience over quality cooked meals. This has led me to rapidly lose some of the health gains I had previously made after months of dedicated WFPB eating.

I have done all the research and I know how bad these foods are health-wise, but I am currently struggling with trying to will myself back onto a fully WFPB diet. I have tried to cut it out several times, but thus far I have only had short-term success before once again falling off track and gorging on non-WFPB foods. I am trying quite hard, but there seems to be a psychological tether that is making it quite difficult to regain my control.

1587,o4gohp,PlantBasedDiet,"I... lost my father to cancer of the pancreas. It came in a wave of symptoms , and the diagnosis was given as a death sentence. I had been having a terrible health experience when I was really young. My disability was nonstop given as the reason, so I never questioned it. I got so sick of it at 13 I gave up listening to them and began learning on my own. And there it was: every symptom had an association of some kind to my diet. And, given that a grandparent of my fathers also died of cancer, that terrified me. 

I stripped all the animal foods right away. I was ‚Äúover reacting‚Äù, ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù, ‚Äúhurting X persons feelings‚Äù by rejecting their food. It was all thrown at me. 

I had rashes that filled my body and sometimes ended up on my face. The doctors strongest treatment did nothing. ‚ÄúMaybe we need to give you meds. It‚Äôs risky tho, it reduces your immune system. So really consider if you can‚Äôt live with this.‚Äù (Me: maybe this is diet related doc? Doc: LOL no. It has nothing to do with diet, it‚Äôs genetic). So destroying my immune system is not extreme, but changing my diet is? Ookay.

Rashes were the first thing that went away. Literally vanished in a few months. People around me excused that away. ‚ÄúNo. It wasn‚Äôt the diet. You stopped scratching like we all told you. ‚Äú or... ya know... inflammation went down, it no longer was itchy, and the inflammation being down cured it.

Then, my pain reduced. I began walking more as a result of that pain reduction. Again, hand waved it away while still saying I was being rude and moronic for not eating animals. ‚ÄúYou are moving more and that reduced your pain. If you just listened when I told you to do morning walks you could be eating the same thing. This is the placebo effect.‚Äù

My adhd symptoms really improved when my research into plant based eating lead me to the Methyl B12 and Folate forms being shown to help symptoms. I have already been eating those forms in greens, so I couldn‚Äôt figure out what was going on . Why was I getting a benefit? Once I began supplanting and maxing our that benefit, I had way more energy. Everyone noticed. I was even running. I threw my walking aid away (cane I use to use). 

Would this transformation be hand waved away? God dam right it did. And the hostility towards me just changing my diet also spiked. now I was attacking them apparently. ‚ÄúTell me right now why you are accusing me of eating an unhealthy diet.‚Äù ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say anything, I‚Äôm not doing this, drop it‚Äù. ‚ÄúNo. I work hard to inspect where my food comes from and by rejecting basic science with removing protein you are going to get sick. I‚Äôm trying to help you but there is only so much I can do before you fall off the deep end. And by eating that nonsense (oatmeal and blueberries while everyone else ate pasta with meat sauce) it‚Äôs looking like you‚Äôll get diabetes soon.

This caused massive fights after 3 years of being becoming active, losing 20 lbs without trying (they refused to believe I wasn‚Äôt calorie counting and non stop asked me for my deficit to make sure I was being ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù about this.)

Now, this was all abusive extended family I use to interact with. My father was the opposite. Loving parent. Loving guy. ‚ÄúHey, if you are learning more about eating healthy I‚Äôm on board with your choice‚Äù. He even defended me and halted insults and freak outs directed at me. Numerous times he would see a relative beginning to yell when I would only eat the meal parts that were not animal based. ‚ÄúDoes he tell YOU what to eat Steve? Maybe I should start pointing out that cookies you eat are unhealthy. Lotta sugar there buddy your gonna get fat.  Don‚Äôt get mad I‚Äôm being helpful! Stop attacking my son for his choices or I‚Äôll do it to you‚Äù.

Unfortunately... he never accepted the science. He was in a chronic state of pain on pain meds that didn‚Äôt work.the healthier I got, the weaker and sicker he got. I kindly and non - judgement way tried to show him the control trials... but it was clear his food addiction won .

He hit 50, like his father who ate the same, and died sooner than he should have. He began losing weight too fast... and they found tumors on his pancreas. He chose to change his diet ... but his body no longer could handle the fiber .

I couldn‚Äôt hold it together watching him cry trying to eat without pain. ‚ÄúI screwed up. And now it hurts so much I can‚Äôt even try berries and other healthy foods. I‚Äôm sorry (me), my choices may have cost you your only parent.‚Äù

I was with him when he passed . Sadness. Anxiety. Fear. He couldn‚Äôt even eat the foods he loved anymore.

Dad. I miss you so much. You did nothing wrong , you were never taught this information. I should have tried harder to make it easy to understand . 

I love you. I miss you. You didn‚Äôt abuse me like everyone else. Today is a black soul day without you. I just... you were my best friend. And all I want to hear is that despite my mistakes taking care of you , that you thought I did a good job.

&gt;What I would like to do is to go back in time, and I want to sit down with my dad, and I want to say, ""Dad, I found out something really important. We can change our diet, we don't really need that cheese and that bacon. There's plenty of healthy things that we can eat. Let's bring in the colorful vegetables and fruits, let's make them part of our everyday fair. Let's lace up our sneakers, let's exercise together."" It's too late for him. But it's not too late for you.

This resonated with me a lot because I feel like I am at the point where it's still not too late for my own dad, even though he struggles with asthma, arthritis &amp; possibly is diabetic. Yet, I feel powerless in trying to nudge him towards a WFPB Diet, even by an inch. I tried my best, but he found healthy alternatives to the food he was eating which I served him to be entirely dubious and basically inedible. It doesn't seem likely he will change his eating habits, at least not anytime soon.  


I feel like in the future... when my dad is dead early and/or spends his last moments on Earth being in a state you could barely call ""living,"" I will think back to this moment... wishing I had a time machine. Maybe I should have tried more. Maybe I should have had more patience. Maybe I didn't push him hard enough. Maybe I should have been smarter in my approach. I was successful in changing my mother and brother, but I feel like I will lose my father in the future. Dying of a cause easily preventable. And spending his last years on this planet not in good health. I hope that doesn't end up true. And I wish everyone luck with convincing your own loved ones if you are in a similar situation.

Today my dad mentioned that he heard lima beans contained cyanide. I dismissed it at first as probably only negligible trace amounts.

It's been tough for me to find info on this, but from what I've read so far it's no longer clear to me that it's negligible. Most sites recommend cooking lima beans before eating, at least in part to neutralize the cyanide-producing compound.

So I have 3 questions:

1. Do raw lima beans contain enough cyanide that a 1/2 cup a day is something worth trying to avoid?
2. Are frozen lima beans raw, blanched, or cooked long enough to address the cyanide concern? Should I microwave them for a few minutes before putting them in the smoothie?
3. What's the best or your go-to bean for smoothies? Looking for ones that are easy and don't take over the taste of the smoothie.

No meat, no dairy or animal byproducts has been scientifically proven to drastically reduce the risk/prolong the onset/can even prevent Alzheimer's.

I can bench 100kg for reps, deadlift 180kg for reps and squat 127.5 kg for reps. My diet is filled with 'good' and 'bad'. I primarily eat lean meat and veggies for lunch, for breakfast I eat some sort of greek yogurt and dinner is a bit murky, sometimes it's junk, other times it's something like tuna and salad (1 a week to prevent mercury poisoning).

I am 177cm and weigh 91kg. 

My blood results are as follows:
Total Cholesterol - 6.46 mmol/L (3.9 - 5.2)
LDL - 4.28 mmol/L ( it should be less than 3.30 optimally)
HDL - 1.53 mmol/L (it should be more than 1.55 optimally)

Honestly I've tried reading about if statins but there's just so much info that I don't know if they are a good trade off for side effects they give in comparison to benefit. I don't know if my levels can be controlled with diet and exercise, I can try, but even when I did cardio a few years ago and was leaner my cholesterol was still not really good. My diet was still not perfect tho. Only once my results showed good measurements.

With all this in mind, I don't know if I should take statins if doc recommends them. They have benefits and sides, but those benefits need to outweigh the sides but also those benefits need to be there in the first place. Meaning if you don't need to lower cholesterol due to ridiculous small reference values why would you? I am not well versed in science, I am just thinking out loud.

I know that for example my psychiatrist gave me SSRI and 'benefits' weren't worth the sides. There were actually no benefits, I was still depressed but I also got sides that remained despite me quitting meds. I don't want that this time.

""We might be fat, but we're healthy fat"" is something that they would totally say. You get the idea.

However, to my surprise, they (4) mentioned that, according to their latest test results, they're all either very healthy or perfectly healthy (one of them mentioned that his uric acid level is just 1 point above normal).

Now, obviously they could all be lying, but I doubt it. Assuming that they're not, my question is: how is this even possible? Are some people better suited to process meat without in a less harmful way? Or do general health checkups don't paint the full picture (they measured at least cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, and uric acid)? Is health lost 'gradually, then suddenly'? Or is it that they're still relatively young and can get away with it? Are we as a community just overly-conscious about our health? Or is there something that I'm missing? 

To be honest, I'm choosing this lifestyle because I care about my health and I'm convinced that this is the healthiest way to live long-term. I just wonder sometimes why some people can apparently just get away with it.",Can people be fat and healthy? How is health actually lost?

1735,nvia9b,PlantBasedDiet,"I love being on a plant based diet. Not only have my taste buds changed that fruit tastes like candy, but: my pain has reduced; my cardio system is so good that no matter how much normal day to day movement I perform I feel not out of breath; I am walking EVERY MORNING and i feel even BETTER every day I do it; I recover from exercise so well that I dont get DOMS, nor does exercising the day before ever prevent me form doing it again the next day.  


I am also really low income, and my food budget has dropped to about 30-40 dollars every shopping trip (I go shopping maybe 2 times a month).   


However...the second my family and certain friends find out...it always follows a repeat pattern (unless they are in the minority of heavy good person, and accepting me for who I am);  


1. They find out I am eating plant based and dont consume animal products. They ask me why. I tell them ""I am not a vegan. I just love the taste. I feel more energized and less depressed. I am NOT judging you for eating the diet.
2. They begin asking me what evidence I am relying on to determine if the plant diet is healthier out of concern for my health. I supply either [nutritionfacts.org](https://nutritionfacts.org) videos or the studies themselves. Those get determined to be ""vegan bias"", despite the fact that science nor that website promotes veganism, and just promotes a plant based diet. But I dont push back at all, and I say ""ill look into your resources you provided, thanks, its also fine if we disagree, its okay!""
3. Certain people begin to link me more and more ""evidence"" that my diet is not healthier despite me never instigating a ""research war"". Either I dont respond and they get upset, or I respond.
4. Because I eventually respond to their research, they grow increasingly hostile to me by either not responding to me as often as they use to , or they outright tell me ""I dislike how often you are judging me for my diet, its not okay"". Despite the fact that I am never instigating it. 

It feels like me just not consuming animal products by choice results in me 100% of the time being considered an outcast , and I have people beginning to judge me no matter what I do.  


What do you do when you experience this clear persistent bias? Ive considered just straight up lying to people from now on. Instead of telling them I feel way better, I might just say ""I have a condition I dont want to discuss that requires me to consume no animal products, can we not bring this up?""  


This topic always results in some level of negativity if the person opposite to me consumes animal products. My mere PRESENCE of a plant based eater at a dinner table among friends will 100% of the time begin this pattern.

That was the main driver of me switching my diet. pancreatic cancer killed my father, and to be honest...he was in so much fucking pain....he died in sheer agony and it fucking broke my heart to see someone I love die like that. and i couldnt do a fucking thing no matter how often I tried to help him. And he REGRETTED EATING ANIMAL PRODUCTS at the end, and desperately tried to cling to life by switching to a plant based diet. but it was too late...because his body no longer could digest food properly because the cancer spread to his stomach....and he just sat there crying in the end: ""I can't even eat food anymore without 3 acid pills...and it still doesnt work and im in pain every time. I cant even eat, fiber is even worse. I hate this, i WISH i didnt eat those foods. I am being killed by the food i loved, and even in the end I cant eat it anymore, why me?""  


It was the most painful thing ive ever experienced in my entire life. I saw him slowly getting weaker and weaker.  More and more bones were crafting his image as the fat and muscle dissolved. His face looked like a skeleton, his arms looked like twigs, and his spirit died. And a week before he died, he was so deficient in calories from the lack of eating that his mind went away....and I just cried realizing I just lost my father forever...and I lost my chance to say goodbye to the man I loved and called my best friend.  


You handed him coffee. He would keep repeating ""can I have my coffee OP. Please?"" and no matter how many times you told him he had it, he would keep asking. And then you would call the ambulance to take him to the hospital and he puts up a massive fight because he doesnt realize hes sick ""im fine , im fine, stop, we cant afford this insurance costs. we dont have insurance to cover some of this, OP no you dont understand this is too much money. it will take me a decade to pay this back. please dont bankrupt me."" And you just dont have the heart to tell him: ""dad....it doesnt look like you are going to make it another week....the cost doesnt matter anymore....im sorry"".   


I see all this research showing the positive effects of plants and the negative effects of animal products. And I want to do everything in my power to prevent my future kids from ever having to suffer what I suffered through. to see someone they cared about dying in agony...to wake up one morning to see their parent staring at the cealing, breathing in small strained breaths, not able to respond to anything I say...realizing that this was it...saying goodbye. and having to sit with him for 2 HOURS while that strained breathing indicated he was going...but with no real timer to tell me when he would be gone....with a DNR order preventing me from trying to save him....I watched him fucking die for TWO FUCKING HOURS and couldnt do a dam fucking thing.

The mushrooms I have available in my country are: porcini mushrooms, chanterelles girolles, Shiitake, king boletes, beech mushrooms, oyster mushroom, portobello mushrooms, enoki mushrooms, Chestnut mushroom and white mushrooms. (Sorry if anything doesn‚Äôt make sense I had to find the translations)

Hope to hear fun suggestions or ideas :)",What type of mushroom do you recommend for someone who dislikes the texture of mushrooms?

1832,nq4c3b,PlantBasedDiet,"Hi everyone! I recently switched from a ketogenic diet to WFPB. It was pretty much an overnight switch, so I didn't have a period to ease in. I've tried being vegan before, but wasn't doing it correctly (still ate lots of refined carbs, etc.).

My first and foremost goal is to be as healthy as possible. I'm done with dietary hacks and obsessing about the scale. I know that if eat in a clean and healthy way, I'll loose weight.

Now I'm trying to tune my macros/diet.

About me: 35 yo, 238lbs. Moderately active (3-5 days/week).

Using the [TDEE Calculator](https://tdeecalculator.net/) suggested in r/loseit, these are the suggested macros (using a 30/20/50 High Carb pattern):

* Maintenance: 2,544 calories/day
* Cutting: 2,044 calories/day
* Protein: 153g
* Fats: 43g
* Carbs: 255g

I'm using Cronometer to log what I eat, but I'm still struggling to meet my protein needs, even after having some protein powder (which I'm not a big fan of, I'd rather stay off it if possible).

I'm also trying to do 16/8 IF but so far I'm reconsidering if the ketogenic effects of IF are really worth the overeating I have to do at breakfast and lunch.

A typical day of eating looks like this:

* Breakfast: 
    - Oats &amp; fruit
        - 50g rolled oats
        - 10g pecans
        - 10g walnuts
        - 5g almonds
        - 1/2 tbsp chia seeds
        - 1/2 tbsp hemp seeds
        - 1/2 tbsp flax seed
        - 1/2 tbsp pumpkin seeds
        - 30g blueberries
        - 60-70g strawberries (4)
        - A few goji berries
    - Smoothie
        - 1 cup of sugar-free almond milk
        - 1/2 banana
        - 1 big scoop of peanut butter
        - 2 scoops of Orgain protein powder
* Lunch
    - 80g black beans
    - 80g lentils
    - 80g chickpeas or hummus
    - 80g quinoa
    - 80g brown rice
    - 1 potato
    - Salad or cooked veggies (dark leafy greens, tomato, mushrooms, etc.).
    - Avocado (1/2 of a small one or 1/4 of a large one).

My issue here is that, after eating all of that, I'm still at ~1,500 calories and 70g of protein (and that's considering that Cronometer overcounts the calories in oatmeal by a factor of 3, so realistically I'm having some 200 less calories than what Cronometer says, and adding the smoothie which I didn't have initially). I don't feel hungry by dinner time, but I kind of try to eat something to bump up my protein intake. However, I don't want to force feed myself.

[Here are my Cronometer stats](https://imgur.com/a/gOohbZU)

Any suggestions on how I can improve my meals? Should I eat until I feel full or do I need to grow a bigger stomach to process all those delicious plants? Or might there be something wrong about the way I'm logging in my calories? 

Any help would be super appreciated!","10 days into WFPB, coming from keto. Struggling with macros/protein."

However, I recently dove deeper into alcohol by watching all the videos/reading all the studies about how alcohol is actually a carcinogen. A potentially big one, too. So I decided I would cut it out, or at least reduce it dramatically. This whole week was easy up until tonight (Friday) when my boyfriend and some friends and I went out to dinner.

I'm only 95% plant-based so I hope this isn't an issue. If it is, feel free to delete.

Anyway, I just started a few months ago due to health reasons (autoimmune condition - eczema, gut issues, and hormonal imbalance)

I've been eating mostly legumes, rice, oatmeal, whole grain bread, and a lot of fruit. And holy crap, what a difference this diet has made in my life.

First of all, my gut health hasn't been this good in a while. Antibiotic usage from a few years ago completely destroyed my gut health and I was suffering from a lot of food intolerances but now I've been able to successfully incorporate all those foods back into my diet (nightshades, gluten, grains, etc)

Second of all, my skin looks amazing now (during the first few weeks I had horrible skin breakouts after reintroducing some foods, but it went away). Now, I haven't had any major eczema flare-ups and the horrible chin acne I've been having on and off for years has completely gone away without any acne medication.

And third, I'm at the leanest I've ever been in my life.

I've been pretty active for a while now, but I just haven't been able to shed the fat. I had also been dealing with some hormonal issues, which I suspect was one of the reasons for not being able to shed some fat.

FYI, I'm still currently at the same weight, my body composition just changed. I'm so much leaner now and I can finally see muscle definition.

What's crazy is I haven't changed my exercise routine, I actually workout less now, and I even eat a lot of white rice and noodles. Yet the fat is just coming off so easily now!

Taking the plant-based route has been one of the best decisions I've made in my life. And btw, the book Fiber Fueled brought me to this point. So thank you Dr. Will Bulsiewicz! If you haven't read that book yet, go pick it up now! Worth every penny and time.

It began a couple of months ago and has been on and off since then. I‚Äôm pretty convinced it‚Äôs due to the diet, as I‚Äôve never had a similar feeling before; however, I‚Äôm not eating anything that I haven‚Äôt eaten before. I am, on the other hand, eating more tofu, beans, whole grains, fruit, and vegetables than before, so hard to narrow down.

For reference, I‚Äôm 26M, 165 lbs., with no preexisting conditions. I‚Äôd be surprised if I had a deficiency - I‚Äôm eating way healthier than before, hitting the daily dozen most days, get b-12 from my daily plant milk, take a multi-vitamin and vitamin-d daily, the occasional extra b-12. 

If it helps, this is my standard daily meal plan (with mild variations)

Breakfast: Rolled Oats with plant (soy or oat) milk, chia seeds, flax seeds, banana, a dash of peanut butter and a few dark chocolate chips or cacao powder.

Mid-morning snack: An apple.

Lunch: generally a meal prepped with whole grains (brown rice or quinoa), beans (black or chickpeas), and vegetables. My go-to‚Äôs are lentil stew, burrito bowls, pasta with chickpeas and veggies.

Afternoon snacks: carrots or cucumbers and hummus, occasional dark chocolate, maybe some more fruit, and the occasional handful of chips (I know, not WFPB).

Dinner: Big smoothie with lots of greens (usually broccoli, spinach, and/or kale), vegan protein powder or Huel, blueberries, turmeric, avocados, sometimes hemp/chia.

Hope this detail helps!

I've been trying to adopt a WFPB diet for about 4 years now, but after 20+ years of binge eating I find I keep falling into the same loop.  


1. Eat WFPB for 1-3 days.
2. Feel cravings for unhealthy food (sugar, oil, refined flour, fried food)
3. Binge eat for 3-14 days (almost all meals are junk, takeout, etc.)
4. Feel bad enough to try and restart
5. Either restart with a varied WFPB diet or, more often, attempt a strict monodiet (potato fast)  

6. Go to 1.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand all the science behind this - how dopamine signaling plays into binge eating, how taste buds affect signaling and how long it takes for taste buds to reset to lower levels of palatability, how the gut biome affects mental health... but I cannot seem to get over the hump of 21 or 30 days or however long it takes. For those 1-3 days it takes real effort, a fight with each meal, and then I wear out. Or, I feel OK with the meals but I get frustrated that i don't feel better and I give up because it seems pointless.  


Can anyone relate? Has anyone overcome this?

2 years ago i went fully plant based and as I am health focused it means there was no junk food etc but just whole plant foods.

I like to do a bit of exercise each day and for a few months of the year i will also focus on full body muscle building to maintain a decent core.

Because of this getting enough protein is important to me. Im not talking over 1gram per kg in weight, but a decent 0.7 or 0.8g per kg as I have a big frame from someone whos 5 foot 8.

So naturally I would vary my protien to try and insure i was getting enough amino acid types that i could make complete protiens etc.

This worked great until a month or 2 ago when i started to have great pain all around my digestive system and it would swell up bad and have a lot of trapped gas. This could last for a few hours of pain and I woild have to try walk it off. Also some bad wc would happen and i would eat light and ot would be ok then. 

I loved eating a lot of lentils and chic peas and beans for my protien but these seem to be the key culprits. I cut them out for a few weeks and had no issues and i started to slowly added them back in with a small amount of beans yesterday and today and today it flared up again. 

My fear is now I will have to start eating fish like sardins mackeral and salmon again in order to get the protien ans iron etc I need and want as my favourite sources no longer seem to agree with my gut.

 I can get her to eat some fruits and veggies, mostly fruit since its sugary and like candy/ ice cream which she's constantly begging for. Carrots and broccoli gets eaten, but only with ranch. I've tried cooking them all sorts of ways. 

I just made cheezy chickpeas. They taste like macaroni and cheese and she still cried about them and will not eat them. I asked what she wamts on them. More salt? More pepper? Ketchup? Ranch? Nope... She wants pepperonis on them. Honestly, I wish I had them on hand to get her to eat. 

I dont mind compromising. Im not trying to be a religious fanatic when it comes to this diet. If a few pepperonis gets her to eat some overall healthy food, whatever... I already cook two seperate meals at times just to make sure she eats something. She's always been a low percentile weight (long before I committed to not eating crap).

 Her doctor recommended booster shakes. So even on my stricter nights where i'm adamant that she ""eat your dinner or go to bed without dinner"" i end up caving. Let's face it.

**TLDR:** Just the title. Also, tips for eating and buying cheaply would also be appreciated.

**Context**

Currently, here's why I tend to eat on a regular basis.

For **breakfast**, I usually eat 4 slices of bread with peanut butter (outside of what I use on the bread, I eat about 3 scoops). Another option includes oatmeal.

For **lunch**, I either eat the same thing, or cereal with soy milk. On rare times, we would get takeout as well.

For **dinner**, I eat rice. Or the same thing I had for breakfast.

For **snacks**, I eat fruit, crackers and occasionally peanuts or lettuce.

(I also eat multivitamins on a semi-regular basis)

As you can tell, my diet is pretty shitty.

Since I began to become vegan (not for health reasons, but for ethical ones), and out of a desire to be a functional adult, I've started to research how to eat healthy.

I decided to divide my diet into 5 food groups and 4 meals.

*Food Groups*

* Fruit
* Vegetables
* Whole Grains
* Legumes
* Nuts &amp; Seeds

*Meals*

* Breakfast
* Lunch
* Snacks
* Dinner

I've also done research on the slew of nutrients I need for a healthy diet.

**Problem**

My main issues with my diet are the following:

* It lacks in variety in terms of food groups (mostly Grains)
* It's probably deficient in nutrients or calories.
* I tend to eat the same thing a lot of the time.

As a result, I want to be more educated on planning meals for my health and general well-being.

But I'm an absolute beginner when to meal planning.

* I don't plan my meals ahead of time, which I know would cause issues in the long run.
* I've researched the food groups and nutrients involved in a healthy vegan diet, but I don't know how to coherently combine all of these into balanced meals, or an actual plan.
* I've realized that I haven't really ""explored the food world,"" which I believe is one of the reasons why my diet is so monotonous. I typically think ""bread, oatmeal"" for breakfast, and ""sandwich, rice"" for lunch and dinner. I never really had foods like ""soups"", ""casseroles"", ""salads"", ""stews"", ""burritos"" or stuff like that before. I never really tried that many vegetables or beans either. I've never tried tofu or tempeh before as well. There are thousands of other foods/meals out there, and I'm unfamiliar with many of them. This is something I would like to improve on.
* I don't know how to cook. Although, I have recently learned how to make oatmeal.

2037,nb5k82,PlantBasedDiet,"Okay, so here's what's going on. Initially, I was just making a quart of mixed nut milk and I'd use the pulp to make a cheese and eat it with some cookies I make and everything was fine. The volume of pulp was manageable and I found a good use for it.

I then started making the almond-sesame seed-rice yogurt /u/iLoveSev had posted about earlier. Problem? I'm making double the amount (I want to ideally eat some yogurt after both lunch and dinner, so even double the recipe amount will only last me two days or so) and I'm using brown/red rice (rather than the white rice used there), which means I'm getting a ridiculous amount of pulp from this. Okay, no problem. I'll just start putting pulp into my pancakes in the morning. This is getting to be a problem, but I think I can make this work.

Then, I realized that I'm using about a cup of my mixed nut milk a day for the pancakes, which means that the milk is disappearing twice as quickly (I usually drink about a cup of it with my chai in the morning). I decided to make sunflower seed milk instead for the pancakes (since I'm not made of money). This, I think, crosses an inflection point.

I'm currently sitting with the pulp from the last time I made the yogurt, *this* time I made the yogurt, and the sunflower seed milk I just made. On top of this, I'm sitting on the cheese from the last quart of nut milk I made (which I finished in two days...). I'm at the point where I'm not even sure how to store all this pulp, let alone use it.

2045,navzcb,PlantBasedDiet,"So, I've taken the regular banana oat nutmilk pancakes and started playing with them to see how nutritionally dense I can make them.

1. 1 cup rolled oats
2. 1/2 cup leftover pulp from making almond-sesame seed-rice yogurt
3. 3 tbsp chia seeds
4. 3 tbsp sesame seeds
5. 1 medium banana
6. 1 cup nutmilk
7. Mystery ingredient for variety (blueberries, cacao, etc)

I usually run the oats and chia seeds first through the food processor to break them down before adding the rest of the ingredients. This amount usually makes 2 medium-to-large pancakes (they come out much larger because of the extra pulp). The pancakes come out delicious and there's endless variety because of ingredient number 7. The nutmilk amount is increased here because of the chia seeds, since otherwise the batter will be too dry.

Based on just the oats, bananas, and seeds, I get:

1. at least 25 grams of protein
2. at least 26 grams of fiber
3. at least 29 grams of healthy fats
4. about 40% or so of the daily intake for calcium

I have not included the nutrition content for the fiber (not sure exactly what's in it and what makes it into the milk), nutmilk (depends on how you make it or what brand you buy), or the mystery ingredient (because it's, well, a mystery). All told, it's likely over 1000 calories, especially if you make fairly thick nutmilk like I do.

2050,nakv2u,PlantBasedDiet,"Hi guys, I would love some input on how you deal with food miles and the carbon emissions of your diets. I haven't eaten farmed animal products in about 7 years, but in that time I was hunting and spearfishing to ensure my protein sources were as low impact and sustainable as possible.

Recently, my wife (who was vegan before we met and began eating my harvested animal products soon after we started dating on her own volition) has decided she would like to return to a strictly plant based diet. By default I have hung up my speargun and bow and gladly matched her diet.

I am a freelancer with lots of spare time and do all of the cooking and shopping for us. I love cooking and eating a plant based diet but recently I have begun to struggle with the packaging and food miles behind every source of protein I can find.

Living the most harmonious with nature and lowest carbon footprint lifestyle is what matters most to me and the amount of packaging and food miles behind beans, tofu, tempeh, protein powders, nuts, legumes, and everything else I can think of to buy for us is so disheartening. It feels like I was living much more harmoniously with the local environment when I was selectively harvesting it myself. 

Going in to shops and buying big bags of beans that were factory farmed and shipped countless miles feels like it must be doing so much harm to many different ecosystems before it ends up on my plate. I end up feeling grossed out and sad by the food I cook.

Am I overreacting? Am I missing a protein source? Can someone link an up to date peer reviewed paper about the impact of the production and transportation of common vegan protein sources? 

For context, I find all meat farming to be deplorable and realize that hunting and gathering is not a sustainable practice for most of the world's population. I will forever support all of those who do not consume animal products and believe the world would be a better and greener place if livestock farming was replaced with other means of protein production. Also, I forage lots of our food  while I'm out at work or climbing (mostly mushrooms and green leafy stuff at this time of year) and we grow as much veg and legumes as we can.

More than anything I do not want to turn this into an argument about ethics and morals. I just want in making personal dietary choices that cause the very least impact on the world around me.

Should i wait till may 25 and continue waiting for a considerably better discount or should i bulk order for around 70 dollars (total of 3,200 grams of hempseeds).

I could use some omega 3 in my diet, I hate blending flaxseeds however when i cook i add them a tbsp at the end, idk if slightly cooking them helps with digesting them, does it? 

Anyway i know that regardless whole flaxseeds are still greatly beneficial, for the gut.

I don't think I'd have a problem waiting for a better discount, but summer is coming, weather is getting hotter, shipping will take around 2 weeks i think.

If im gonna bulk order and the hot weather is gonna degrade the hempseeds then i may as well just order them now instead of waiting to save some money.

I'm buying them not just for omega 3 but also because they're low in net carbs and extremely heigh in nutrients, not that i have anything against carbs, it's just because i have a cavity that i need to go get fixed at the dentist.",Is it bad to order hulled hempseeds in hot weather?

The reason im asking is I'm ordering acerola cherry freeze dried powder from a store, they also sell maqui berry powder too.

Why powder?

I don't eat berries, they're sour and they're bad for my teeth, i have cavities and i can't go to the dentist in at least over a month, plus i hate berries anyway, blackberries are way too sour, so are raspberries, blueberries being the least so but still very sour and not that good tasting.

Maybe the fresh ones are better but it's hard to find those, mostly they sell frozen bags of these where i live.

Anyway the price for 250 grams of maqui berry freeze dried powder is 27 dollars, adjusted with the shipping price they'd probably cost around 35 dollars? 

It's 27 for maqui, and around 29 for acerola (contains more than daily requirement of vitamin c per 1 dried gram). And as for the shipping it's 14 dollars.


I would be taking around half a gram of freeze dried maqui a day, in the form of a capsule which I'll be filling myself, as to prevent the berry powder from coming into contact with my teeth and lowering the ph of my mouth.

Half a gram is very little but I'm sure since it's very potent it'd be more than enough to make a difference.

As for acerola it'd be half a gram to a gram.

I would probably up the dose of the maqui to a gram but it'd mean swallowing more capsules or bigger capsules, I'm like yeah i won't bother, at the same time I'll save money.

The berry powder ends up cheap, because it's like 35 usd but 250 grams would last at least a year, so 35 usd for at least a year is not much.

J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci. 2005 Jul;60(7):862-5.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16079208

Abstract

BACKGROUND:
Our goal was to assess the prevalence of common causes of death and the demographic variables in a selected population of centenarians.

METHODS:
The autopsy reports and medical histories of all individuals &gt; or =100 years, dying unexpectedly out of hospital, were gathered from 42,398 consecutive autopsies, performed over a period of 18 years at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, Vienna. These records were evaluated with regard to age and sex, circumstances of death, season, time and the cause of death, as well as the presence of any other comorbidity.

RESULTS:
Forty centenarians (11 men, 29 women) were identified with a median age of 102 +/- 2.0 (range: 100-108) years. Sixty percent were described as having been healthy before death. However, an acute organic failure causing death was found in 100%, including cardiovascular diseases in 68%, respiratory illnesses in 25%, gastrointestinal disorders in 5%, and cerebrovascular disease in 2%. Additionally, centenarians suffered from several comorbidities (cardiac antecedents, neurologic disorders, liver diseases, cholecystolithiasis), which were not judged to be the cause of death.

CONCLUSIONS:
Centenarians, though perceived to have been healthy just prior to death, succumbed to diseases in 100% of the cases examined. They did not die merely ""of old age."" The 100% post mortem diagnosis of death as a result of acute organic failure justifies autopsy as a legal requirement for this clinically difficult age group.

I have switched to a mostly WFPB diet approach to eating! I have about 25 pounds of weight to lose (I‚Äôm switching to more endurance style training from a more strength training approach). I‚Äôm on the highest end of my BMI but have a lot of muscle mass. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 F and 158 pounds.

I decided to adopt the Starch Solution approach for the time being as it seems to really work for people. I was just wondering as I‚Äôve tracked calories on a few days - I‚Äôm eating 1200-1400 calories a day - which is very LITTLE calorie wise for me (my TDEE is between 2300-2400). But I feel full and satiated. 

Does anyone know if I continue to eat very low calories for around 3-4 months and under my BMR - if it will severely impact my metabolism once I‚Äôve reached my weight goal?

2192,n2m8pm,PlantBasedDiet,"Hi, new to this community.

I been reading and watchinf videos and I cant seem to find this soecific anawer.

So this is what ai understand (maybe you can correct me too).  When you eat carbs, turns to glycogen, goes into blood stream and insulin comes in. Sugar is stored first into muscles, then Liver, ans rest as fat.

So, if all the carbs, plant based that is, I eat, is used up from moving/exercises/or sleeping(thermogenesis), then insulin  takes sugar from muscles (assuming im eating proteins chickpeas too etc), it would be burned off first, then liver sugars is burned off. 

So, if in eating alot of good carbs, how is my stored fat from many many years, will burn off if insulin keeps burning my sugars and not my fat ? 

I can think of the laws of thermodynamics (thermogenesis) ,if im eating so much of the water density plant based carbs, im getting full so less calories and therefore, the rest would be  my stored fat ? And if so, is that from walking, some exercise and fidgeting and sleeping all mixed together to burn it ?

Hope this makes sense üôÉ","How does fat burn off on high carb like McDougal diet when insulin prevents it , is it thermogenesis ?"

Maybe because of that their body just relies on dietary dha and epa so it doesn't try to convert ala, we have seen how the body adapts to stuff, so maybe when we stop consuming dha and epa we become better at converting ala to epa and dha?

I wish there were more studies on this, something that could help support that ALA intake can result in same benefits.

Over this weekend, I made a vegetable/Tofu curry using one of the Patak's simmer sauces that seemed fairly low in fat (just like 3% saturated fat, though probably closer to 10% since I used about three servings). They do list coconut and also canola oil as ingredients. All I did was cut up carrots and a potato, put them in a fry pan with just enough water to come close to covering them, waited until the water partly boiled off then added the Tofu and simmer sauce and some diced green chiles (from a can) and simmered some more.  

I really enjoyed it, and it is an easy three+ servings of beans plus lots of veggies. *But*, I would like to make my own WFPB simmer sauce. I know there are recipes online, but they always seem to have a lot of ingredients and seem complex (I'm not much of a chef). Is there a basic 3-4 ingredient curry simmer sauce I could mix up and have available? Just looking at ""curry"" on Wikipedia seems like the main ingredients are turmeric, cumin, coriander, ginger, and fresh or dried chilies (and probably water to make it a liquid) but I have no idea of the ratios, or if one or two of those could be left out while still tasting good (I'm looking for simplicity here). The chiles could be left out of the sauce and added when simmering as I did before. I know there are pre-mixed curry powders out there but the compositions seem all over the place, and I'd like to not be tied to a single pre-mixed curry brand. 

Any recipes, or links to recipes, for a truly simple WFPB curry simmer sauce that could be mixed up and stuck in the fridge for a week or two? Thanks in advance for any ideas.",Simple WFPB curry simmer sauce?

2360,mtthth,PlantBasedDiet,"Every couple of months I like challenging my own ideas and beliefs, so I search for evidence *against* a whole food plant based diet (amongst other topics). I try to find science-based info, peer-reviewed articles, university based research results, and so on, but I also read from more mainstream sources (my business is in this field, so I want to be up to date with what most people read).

The purpouse is to NOT end up reading Dr. Greger's opinion or any of our old-time favourites', as that would defeat the aim of the exercise.

It often ends up being about [anti-nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/anti-nutrients/), and this time in particular it was all about lectins. A couple of articles got me almost worried and questioning things (before I found out they were linked to Dr Steven Gundry), but a better look around and another little while spent reading online article put my heart back to rest.

Interesting how you get a feeling from the type of words used if the author is trying to sensationalize an aspect of our diet and basically scare people away. Usually 'absolute' words are a big red flag (today reading about ""killer lectins"" gave me a giggle - [https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/foods-high-in-lectins](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/foods-high-in-lectins))

In conclusion, lectins are unavoidable and if properly processed not harmful at all, actually beneficial:

&gt;Avoiding lectins altogether would mean avoiding almost all plant foods, which would mean avoiding a majority of the foods that the longest-lived people in the world consumed every day of their lives as well as the foods shown to reduce risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes. Cooking properly, soaking, or buying canned beans protect you from digestive discomfort and potential harm.¬†

After watching a bunch of documentaries (What the health, among others) and generally feeling lethargic on my animal product rich lifestyle, plus reading about the animal product link to diabetes, heart disease and cancer, I figured it's time for a change. 

I bought the how not to die cookbook, swapped out my diary products with non diary for the transition, but here's the thing. 

Because of financial necessisity I currently live together with my friend who is a nurse and considers herself somewhat of an expert on nutrition. She thinks chicken, fish, eggs and dairy are healthy, etc. She also thinks there's nothing wrong with processed foods. She thinks instant puree is of the same quality as when made from scratch, etc. She is anti salt in home cooked meals but will eat chips and fries in the weekend no problem. She also hates fresh herbs and in general is super picky about food. You get the idea.  

She is also stubborn as a mule when someone disagrees with her. Like, we do great when we agree on stuff, but when we don't it's best to drop the subject alltogether because she won't budge no matter what facts you show her. 

So anyway, I really want to make the change. Problem is we alternate cooking for the both of us, and she has said she is not interested in going plantbased. 

I want to propose cooking our food seperately but since I have been doing the bulk of the shopping and cooking anyway over the past year I know that's not going to go over well. 

Basically I want some pointers on how to approach this conversation. My greatest weakness is that I am very sensitive to the judgments of friends and family and while I have made progress, I still find it hard to tackle stuff like this when it comes to big lifestyle changes.

Any tips?",How to talk to my friend and roommate about going plantbased?

Let's see.  I make a lot of minimal starchy veggies like potato baked or ""pan fried"", rice in a saucepan on the stovetop along with salads.  I have no problem going fancy with vegan sushi and all that but that's not my daily cooking which is simple.  I make a lot of soups (tomato, butternut, etc) or stews like lentil stew, bean stews, etc.  Banana nicecream, sure.  When I'm entertaining, I sometime make pasta/sauces or crepes and other such comfort foods.  I don't do much baking involving flour products.

I typically cook for 1-4 people, sometimes more on invite about every other month.

(There are no referral codes, I just want to demonstrate what I have).

**Things I use**:

* Vitamix Blender - smooths soups, makes almond milk or cream, grinds my herbs, fruit smoothies if I wanted them, probably nut butters idk.  A really high speed blender is a game changer for certain things that are best smooth smooth.
* Immersion Blender - rougher results than vitamix but useful in mixing in pot while cooking or crushing ice, etc.
* Ceramic Knives - Chef Knife, Utility Knife.  I use black Kyocera Revolutions.  Ceramic knives are an excellent pairing with vegan cooking as long as you don't bend them - the only food that gave me problems of that sort are butternut squashes.  I used to have a lot of knives, I'm doing fine with a 7"" chef's knive and a small utility knife for processing garlic for 90% daily activity.
* Heavy steel cleaver.  Bashing garlic bulbs and cloves.  From my dad during my omni days.
* Steel Boning Knife and bread knife - when you need flexibility.  Bread with a crust is better with steel than ceramic.
* Small and large peeler - Small is ceramic to reduce browning, large is steel for flexibility for peeling things like butternut squash (ceramic is brittle).
* Induction Stovetop/Cooktop - I just like the speed and control they provide, they heat up and cool down fast.  Cheap countertop ones from Aldi and the like are trash but some online cooktops for around $100 are fine.  Unlike meat, I have very little use for high heat cooking oilless unless it's boiling water, so outlet wattage is fine.
* Mandolin - To make uniform and thin slices like cucumbers for salad or [WFPB potato chips](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/ec1or9/5_minute_oilfree_potato_sweet_potato_tortilla_etc/).
* Mueller Onion Chopper - Coming from a family of chefs, I used to chop all my own veggies by hand, but in bigger batches, I find [anything in this style](https://www.amazon.com/Mueller-Austria-Chopper-Vegetable-Container/dp/B08N9Q24M9) save time if you're making quantity or convenience like uniform slices of mushroom for a mushroom soup.
* Silicon Spatulas and Turners - I especially prefer the [single piece ones](https://www.amazon.com/Silicone-Heat-Resistant-Spatulas-Non-stick-Stainless/dp/B01N32WEAC) as there are no crevices for gunk to hide.
* Pots and pans - 3 nonstick small/medium/lg pan.  One stainless sauce pan.  Cast iron griddle for cooking tortillas.  Dutch oven for stews.
* 6qt Instant Pot - generic cooking, mostly soups and beans, fully or partially.
* Glass Storage containers.  Just hygienic and less worries about microplastics than plastic.
* Chest freezer.  Yup.  Time saver and energy saver.
* Silicon ice cube trays.  I got a fridge/freezer combo without ice dispenser as that feature alone double the fridge's power usage whether or not it's actively used.

Recent addition:
* KitchenAid KCO255BM - I replaced my $25 toaster over for this bigger ""Toaster Oven"" recently, but I love it.  Other than a large dutch oven preparation, I rarely turn on my full size oven on anymore, especially as it's getting warmer, this is just faster and less hassle.  Baked potatoes or anything else.  Timed and turns itself off.  Convection.  I never had an airfryer but I'm assuming with convection this does the same thing much more versatile.

**Things I personally didn't find of use** (doesn't mean it's bad, just not for me and my style of foods) and gave away in meantime:

* Food processor.  Idk, just never used it.
* Dehydrator.  Would love to if I had more herbs but I tend to consume all the ones I grow fresh LOL.
* Breadmaker.  Generally don't consume flour products, buying the odd bread is cheaper for me.
* Spiralizer.  I'm fine eating food in the shape they are in or knife chopped.  Not a big fan of alt pastas.
* Mixer / Stand mixer.  Used this in my baking days but generally stopped.
* Too many Knives - Set.  Even in my omni days, with knife sets used maybe 50% at most, 25% with any regularity.  Chef's knife is always a fine place to start and build up from there.
* Vacuum Sealer - I find gallon ziploc bags and glass storage containers just easier for the type of stuff I cook.  Can get out most air without a machine and freeze with stews in ziploc bag.  I'm not going to vacuum seal cooked pasta, potatos or rice, that stuff is cheap, stores well, and tastes better freshly made.
* Most single use Gadgets.  If a chef's knife can do it 80%, I most likely threw it out.  Or in my omni days, someone got me an egg seperator, even then I just used the egg shells to do the same thing without cleanup.  Or a silicon garlic peeler.

I have been on and off plant based for several years. I started on a really restrictive meal plan. I lost a lot of weight and felt good but it wasn‚Äôt sustainable. It required too much restriction and too little variety.  It also did a number on me mentally with the deprivation/over-indulgence/deprivation cycle. 

Since then I have tried to stay plant based but have been more middle of the road in terms of strictness. Meaning, I wouldn‚Äôt freak out if a baked good has an egg in it on occasion or a little bit of cheese here and there. Slowly over time, the ‚Äúlittle bits‚Äù have become more and more to the point where I am full on eating cheese and some processed foods have come back into my diet. The minute I start thinking of ‚Äúrules‚Äù or ‚Äúrestrictions‚Äù it triggers me and I end up eating ‚Äúcheat foods‚Äù

I should also say I live in a house with non plant based eaters. My will power to resist some of their foods has dwindled too. I‚Äôm not eating meat at all, but too many ‚Äúcheat‚Äù items have become a frequent occurrence. 

I really want to get back to feeling good and eating plant based, but I don‚Äôt want to go back to my original super strict diet either.

TL;DR: My girlfriend invalidates my choice of this way of eating, and it's really starting to impact me.

I've been eating this way more or less since 2012. There have been some backslides, and I've struggled to keep weight down. I'm trying to get back into pure WFPB SOS-free eating. 

* Pure WFPB
* SOS Free
* Time restricted feeding (I've been doing 16:8, but I used to do 19:5 and would like to get back to something like that)
* No concern about just not eating some days

I am also in a new-ish relationship (8 months, but during Covid, so moved slowly). She likes to joke about how she's a ""bad influence"" because when I'm with her I'm more likely to eat food from restaurants, or drink (I've had like 3 drinks since 2012 until I met her - I don't have an alcohol problem, but I just don't think the effects/calories are worth it and don't enjoy it.)

I feel sabotaged - I try to cook healthy for myself, and she'll want to go out (well, order in - it's a pandemic). When I eat garbage food, I have a tendency to go of track for several days to a week. 

I've found that I can cook her something much less healthful, like a quesadilla, and she'll mostly be okay, but she'll REALLY want me to try it (dairy is a trigger for me, and I avoid it 100%) and will joke about sneaking it into my food, or giving me some when I'm asleep. It's a true joke, but it enrages me a little bit.

She's also commented that she thinks I don't get enough salt, and she's worried I'll have electrolyte issues. Fortunately, not a peep about my ""protein"" - she is concerned about hers, but doesn't bring it up for me (she has specific medical needs that make her need to monitor protein intake)

I feel like I'm being invalidated. Like my choice is being belittled, and worse, I feel like I'm losing control.

I've tried converting her - that's not happening, so I abandoned it. I've tried telling her about my issues with food in the past, and that helped a little. I've also conceded to rare and appropriate (even though I'd like to be at a healthy weight first) - meaning for certain rare and appropriate occasions, I'll get decadent food with her - so we did for Valentines day, but she seems to think that means ""Friday"" now, and I'm back at square one. I've started just avoiding eating around her, which is so unhealthy, and is definitely not a long term fix.

I eat a plant based diet, but would like to increase my protein intake. I workout twice most days (I get a lot of people think this is sub optimal, but I have the time, I enjoy it, and quite frankly, I've made better gains doing it this way). 

I get about 3,500 - 4,000 calories per day, and the way I currently eat, I get roughly 150g of protein. I'm not sure on the exact amount as I do not track my calories but I know this is the amount of calories I eat due to me being able to eyeball calories from the days I used to. 

I want to move away from processed foods and try a mainly raw diet. I'm just not sure on exactly how I would obtain this amount of protein? I have tried lower protein amounts but I always seem to take longer to recover. 

Is anyone else in the same boat? Know of any websites that have high protein raw vegan meal plans? Any help on this is appreciated.",(Another) high protein thread..

I‚Äôve been plant-based with the exception of Ensure Plus for two months now, and I would like to find a replacement for this one item. 

Why I drink Ensure Plus: Almost a decade ago, my immune system attacked my digestive system. After surgery to remove part of my small intestine, I‚Äôm fine. However, during that time I lost nearly 60 pounds, became 15 pounds underweight, and  lost most of my hunger cues. I also stopping enjoying eating. While I now sit at a low but healthy weight, I still don‚Äôt have many hunger cues and I don‚Äôt particularly enjoy eating. If I didn‚Äôt have to, I rarely would.

This is where Ensure comes into play. Each 8-oz bottle of Ensure Plus has 350 calories (plus a ton of nutrients). I generally drink one bottle per day, but if I forget to eat, I might drink more at the end of the day. 

I‚Äôve tried searching for plant-based alternatives, but everything I‚Äôve under 200 cals per serving, which just isn‚Äôt enough. 

Also as a note, at present, I have a mini fridge, instant pot, and microwave: no other appliances, so I can‚Äôt store or make many things. I also cant buy fresh fruits and veggies atm. I live in the US.

2687,m1oocc,PlantBasedDiet,"Hi everyone. I've been dabbling in WFPB diet since a few weeks before Christmas. It is a big change so I wasn't beating myself up too much if I wasn't totally strict with it or if I were to ""fall off the wagon"", but now I'm totally hooked!  

I eat 100% WFPB about 4 to 5 days a week while striving for 7 eventually. The other days I would have one small amount of fish or chicken probably 2 to 3 ounces so not a real portion size, or maybe eat something that had eggs or dairy as an ingredient.

Before any one gets preachy about this not being truly WFPB because of what I just shared, let me tell you a little more about my situation. I'm a mom and I have a family who isn't thrilled with this way of eating. I'm cooking 2 different meals at every sitting. With covid and everyone stuck at home, that means 6 meals a day.   I work full-time too. I am lucky that during covid I can work from home, but let me tell you, the struggle is real here with all this darn cooking and meal prep. 

So continuing on with my story, I've been pre-diabetic / non-insulin taking diabetic for 13 years.  In September my A1C, the measure of blood sugar over time, was at an all time high of 6.8.  At 7.0 they usually start you on insulin. 

Here it is, 3 months from when I started the WFPB way of eating and I'm at 5.2 which is considered normal. I've not had a result under 6 in 13 years.  I'm doing a little happy dance now. 

Some of my favorite foods that have made this possible...

Dave's Killer Bagels with almond butter and raspberry all fruit spread

Heirloom tomatoes slices with fresh basil and sea salt

Fruit salad made with lots of berries - strawberries,  blueberries,  raspberries,  and pineapple and mandarin wedges

Whole wheat pasta with Rao's sauce

Oatmeal  with berries and crushed almonds

Pomegranate juice, shooter size portion straight up, or splash in a glass of water.

Vegan Breakfast burritos - basically just  lots of grilled/stir-fried veggies and Mexican seasonings in a tortilla

Yes, I've been eating well on WFPB!  So well I've not lost any weight at all.  I was getting discouraged because of that, but I'll tell you when those recent test results came in, that changed my attitude. I'm more committed now than ever before. I'm confident this is what I need to do and I'm happy to have  community here to share my success with.",Celebration Time! A1C is normal for the first time in 13 years.

Okay, so I tightened up from a fairly healthy vegan diet to a WFPB no oil diet starting in December. My cholesterol dropped dramatically, my metabolism got even faster and I felt the best I ever have just eating plants.

The result was not being able to sleep, having a dull headache ever since and my back throbbing from the inflammation. I can't believe how my body reacts now. I don't ever want to do that again.

I've been vegan for 4 years and in the last year trying make my diet completely WFPB. The only aspect I'm still having difficult with is convenience foods and meals.

I have a chronic pain disease. Often during flare-ups or periods of extreme fatigue... cooking is next to impossible. I tend to rely on convenience foods during these times - microwave meals, oven stuff. Complete meals with little to no prep. I can get by with some things like snacks - having some nuts or fruit but the main meals I really struggle with during these times.

I try to meal prep as much as I can but sometimes these flare-ups can last over a week. I've tried freezing food too but I always have difficult reheating it adequately (I am an idiot) or sometimes, to be embarrassingly honest, my brain gets scrambled and I get brain fog and confused and overwhelmed.

Also - I find then when I am feeling particularly unwell I naturally gravitate towards carb heavy beige food. At the moment I'm struggling to distinguish if that's more for convenience or not.

The prevailing theory is a low carb diet because you starve the yeast, but where it falls flat is that you really aren‚Äôt replenishing your gut where a high starch diet would better excel. The most exciting part, and this is really the main benefit is that you will be having lots of bowl movements throughout the day.

This is where a low carb diet fails because you don‚Äôt really pass much, and pushing the yeast out of your system into your stool controls toxin levels.

This is almost opposite of what every protocol says, so I wanted to come here and ask around if anyone has any advice or experience.

Quite frankly it actually makes a lot of sense, you don‚Äôt really have to starve the yeast so much if you are rebuilding your gut first and foremost, and expelling the waste is your main mechanism of action.

So I‚Äôm on my 2nd week of plant based. Im really liking it so far, I‚Äôm less depressed and don‚Äôt necessarily want meat but I don‚Äôt miss it. I was a huge Low carb  high fat follower for a long time. 

I‚Äôm getting 1800 calories which breaks down to 100ish grams of fiber daily, 290 carbs, and like 50g of fat, 100g protein. It‚Äôs diverse, and completely produce section aside from bulk dry beans I‚Äôve been getting online. I suppose I should mention the 1 tbsp of avacado oil I cook with daily as well. It‚Äôs totally unprocessed and completely whole.

I am absolutely stuffed for the entire day after one green smoothie and a cup of chickpeas. That puts me at like 1000 calories. Do I really need to be forcing down food until I hit like atleast 1800? My biggest problem is understanding ‚Äúwhen I‚Äôm hungry‚Äù. Honestly, I‚Äôm never hungry. I don‚Äôt know what people mean by hungry, and what this feeling of hunger most people get is. I have no problem with taking part in 3 day water fasts every week. I could easily go longer, but I just don‚Äôt feel like I should (totally out of fear of nutritional repercussions, not out of biological feeling or tiredness or mental clarity loss). 

Too stuff down 1800, or to not stuff down 1800?

If you can take something from this with you, that‚Äôs great! If not, no worries. I typed this from a pdf, so apologize for the format. I did make an effort.

* Man, 37.
* Working from home. Around 10 hours a day sitting in front of the computer.
* Some bodyweight exercises (1 hour routine, twice a week), running (10km, once a week), HIIT cardio (whatever nice video I find in youtube).
* Vegan diet. I cook with oil half of the times. I eat hamburgers from time to time (not impossible meat, but those veggie ones), fries, chips, cookies. All of these total around 10% of my diet. The rest is whole food, mostly greens, legumes, fruits, banana smoothies every day. I can get into details but it‚Äôs a general idea.
* Smoothies done with milk alternatives fortified in B12. Around one glass a day. Around one table spoon of nutritional yeast a day (fortified with B12)
* Seeds: flax, pumpkin, hemp, chia. I use them everywhere.
* Apart from the B12 fortified things: no supplements of any kind.

# Conclusions and recommendations  

Your vitamin D levels are very low. Low vitamin D levels can cause various complaints including fatigue, lack of energy and muscle cramps. Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin under influence of sunlight, making it difficult to maintain normal levels during the winter periods. Guidelines from the Dutch Health Board (Gezondheidsraad) recommend to take at least 10 ug of vitamin D supplements on a daily basis for individuals with an increased risk of vitamin D deficiency (e.g. darker skinned individuals, office workers etc.) We recommend you to start suppletion with a daily dose of 300 ‚Äì 880 IE (7.5 ‚Äì 22 mg/day). It can take can up to 4 months before levels have increased sufficiently. You can also start with a start-up regimen of 10.000 IE (250 mg) per day for a maximum of 10 days in case of any symptoms.  

Low folic acid levels Your folic acid levels are mildly decreased. This can cause low hemoglobin levels (anemia). We recommend to use supplements to increase your folic acid levels and prevent developing anemia.  

Eosinophilia:You have a mildly increased eosinophil granulocyte count. This is commonly associated with allergies like asthma, hay fever or food intolerance or seen in parasitic infections.  

# Final thoughts

I feel overall happy. I didn‚Äôt know my Vitamin D was so slow. I was expecting low, but not like that. Regarding folic acid, I can‚Äôt explain that‚Ä¶ I eat greens, green peas, legumes in general. Those are supposed to be reach in folic acid‚Ä¶ I will have to read more about it.

I was so shocked at myself that I made such a basic error - but I honestly didn't feel under-fuelled! So I skipped a bike session and ate all day long instead - hey, presto, back to normal.

I exercise 40+ minutes of cardio every single day. In addition, about 20 minutes of weight lifting 3-4 times a week. 

I finally had my appointment with my Doctor to discuss everything, and he ordered a ton of blood work and urine tests just so we can see where I'm at and to make sure that there's nothing sinister causing my hypertension. 

Well... the results came in and my numbers absolutely great across the board. Overall cholesterol is incredibly low (in the 90s). However, my Ketones are at around 1.5ish. This can be labeled as ketosis. After long cardio sessions I have a very strange metallic taste/smell in my mouth that freaked me out the first time I smelled it. I'm sure it's ketones on my breath. 

My doctor didn't really have any comments on it at all. He just stated that it's due to my diet. My A1C and glucose levels are great and indicate that I do not have diabetes. 

Because my doctor didn't seem to care about it (probably doesn't have much experience with the WFPBD), I'm coming here to ask if anyone else is in ketosis because of the WFPBD?

2962,ljoeow,PlantBasedDiet,"Hello plant based community!

I‚Äôm Dan, developer of [The Scientific Meal Planner](https://scientificmealplanner.com/), and I've recently added some new features!

If you haven‚Äôt heard about it yet, this is a tool which utilizes the latest nutrition science to generate extremely healthy meal plans. You‚Äôre probably aware that science points towards a whole food plant based diet being optimal for health and longevity. This tool reflects that reality.

The meal plan generation algorithm is based on information presented on nutritionfacts.org, which I believe to be the most trustworthy source of evidence based nutrition information. What it currently does is analyze a recipe‚Äôs ingredients (down to the gram) and combine recipes in such a way that every day of the meal plan satisfies (or nearly satisfies) [nutritionfact.org‚Äôs daily dozen](https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2018/03/metric.png) foods you should incorporate into your diet daily.  
If you‚Äôve been following the project, you‚Äôd know that[ I launched it about a year ago as a 100% free public service attempting to survive off of donations](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/fj0mi9/i_built_the_scientific_meal_planner_and_its_100/). This route has unfortunately proven unsustainable financially. I thought long and hard about how to restructure this in a way that supports my mission to accelerate healthy diets while sustaining my ability to continue developing the site.

The result was a premium version that costs $7.99/mo and unlocks convenience features which was added [in the fall](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/jya2g1/the_scientific_meal_planner_fall_update/). The WFPB recipe creator community is an essential part of The Scientific Meal Planner, and thus **half** of all premium subscription revenue will go directly to our recipe creator partners. Every recipe in the site comes from our partners.  
Recent updates bring the premium feature set to:  
\- (NEW) Recipe Time Control: limit recipes to be less than 15minutes, 30minutes, 45minutes, or 1 hour  
\- (NEW) Reminders system: schedule a weekly text message reminding you to make a healthy meal plan  
\- (NEW) Food exclusions for allergies or taste: build a custom list of foods you don't want to appear in your meal plans  
\- Calorie control system  
\- Replace replacements  
\- Shopping lists  
\- Nutrient breakdowns  


You can combine all these different options to get a meal plan where, for example, ""more than 75% of the daily dozen categories are satisfied, every day has 1800-2100 calories, where all recipes take 15 minutes or less, and that does not contain anything I'm allergic to"". 

It is my hope that this premium version can foster a healthy WFPB ecosystem so that myself and recipe creators can both keep working to spread the word about the benefits of a whole food plant based diet. There's now 400 recipes in the system.

**There remains a 100% free version** that gives you healthy meal plans. Nothing is held back in terms of the meal planning algorithm. You just don‚Äôt get the convenience features unless you upgrade to premium. This strikes the right balance between my original vision and the financial realities of developing a web app full time.

This is an ongoing project that will be continually developed as new science becomes available. You can expect the introduction of further factors into the algorithm making the meal plans even healthier. It is intended to be a resource for all who care about applying the scientific evidence to live longer, healthier, happier lives. Consider supporting our work!

In health,

Meals aren't an issues.  My problem is I like chips and things that go crunch.  I've tried making my own corn tortilla chips in the toaster oven (air fryer setting), but they just don't have the right crunch.  My question is, has anyone seen an study or scientific report that discusses eating things like chips made with any of the common types of oils?

2985,liflvu,PlantBasedDiet,"Question on iron. At my last physical in April 2020, my blood hemoglobin was slightly low at 13.2 (with normal listed at 13.5-17.5). At the physical, my doctor suggested I start taking an iron supplement. But I am on the WFPB diet, and my understanding is that iron is often on the low end on WFPB, and that it is better to be too low than too high in iron. Additionally, I donate blood at the allowed rate (once every couple months or so). My doctor agreed that the blood donations might lower the Hb. I suggested I would wait to see if I failed the Red Cross test, which requires a minimum of 13.0 g/dL for men. He thought that made sense and we left it there. 

Since then I have always passed the Red Cross blood test for donating, but just barely, and sometimes only on the second try. They will test on blood drops from both hands and you can donate if you pass on either hand. The test is also imprecise in my experience, as one time I failed on one hand and came in at 15 g/dL on the other. So that had a swing of at least 2 g/dL between the left and right hands, separated in time by about one minute. Looking back on my donor card, most readings (the higher one of the two) come in at around 13.4-13.6 g/dL. 

Today I went to donate and came in too low on both hands, in the 11.x g/dL range. I'm told I can try again as early as tomorrow, and plan on scheduling again for next week. If I come in too low again I will probably hold off on donating until talking with my doctor at my June physical.

I should also add I have not noticed any symptoms of anemia.

So my question is, have others had borderline low blood hemoglobin readings on a WFPB diet, either at Red Cross tests or annual physicals? If so, have you started on an iron supplement (and if so how much)? And how fast do they work -- could I take an iron supplement for a couple days before donating and see a positive effect on my blood hemoglobin, or does it take several weeks to kick in?

   First of all, thank you for allowing me to join this Reddit community, I have really enjoyed following the posts.  I'm writing to you today because I am an undergrad who's about to embark on a semester-long research paper, and the topic is my choice, it just have to have some connection to politics and policy. 

I wanted to reach out to you guys for some inspiration on some topics that I could explore.  If you, a passionate vegan could write a 30-page paper on something wrong in the US in relation to the policy that affects agriculture and our food system, what would you want to write about?  In my nutrition course I took this January I learned that while the USDA's ""MyPlate"" dietary recommendations tell us to eat/drink 3 servings of dairy per day, the World Health Organization's recommendations don't specifically push for the consumption of animal milk at all (except for saying you should choose low-fat dairy rather than full-fat, for example).  This got me wondering why we consume so much dairy in the US and why the government wants us to so badly.  Does the USDA have certain financial reasons for advocating for us to drink cow milk to such great extents, even when it's bad for our health?

   I guess at this point I should let you know that I go to Cornell University, where people literally spend their entire college careers focusing on dairy production.  Sidebar, I also sat next to the author of The China Study, Dr. T Collin Campbell, at a vegan community dinner in Ithaca, and actually held his hand when we said a blessing! It was one of the coolest moments ever. 

Thank you for reading this far into the post.  I know enough about veganism to know why I'm vegan, but not enough nuance of the political sphere that has created the standard western diet, and why some people in the dairy industry get so offended by us using the word ""milk"" in our nut/oat/hemp milks.  I don't buy peanut butter thinking it's nut flavored cow butter lol.  That's beside the point.  If you have any interesting perspectives or information that could help me formulate a topic in my research, I would really appreciate it so much.  This community has done a lot to inform me (vegetarian 7+ years, vegan 2 months and loving it) and I would love to put a paper together that could reflect why we need to adopt a vegan diet for our well-being, for animals' well-being, and the survival of our planet too.

Unless I get high quality meat like grass-fed beef or elk or bison, pretty much every meat that I eat makes me feel sick and it's hard to digest. Dairy makes me feel sick too and I cut that out a long time ago.

I like the way meat substitutes taste and how they cook evenly and are easy to clean up. They're also not all nasty and bloody.

So I went over to the vegan sub and didn't realize that veganism was like a moral sense and not just a diet. They recommended I come here.

I can't say that I don't care about the animals and that that's not unethical, but it doesn't keep me awake at night. What does keep me awake at night though is the amount of resources we waste to make meat.

Ingredients:

4 large yukon gold potatoes (like really large - about 500g each), cut into big pieces (2-inch thick pieces), no need to peel

3 green chilies finely chopped

1 tsp ground cumin

1 tsp ground coriander

1/2 tsp cayenne/red chili powder

1/2 tsp black pepper

salt to taste

a few Tbsp chopped scallions

1. Steam or boil the chopped potatoes. I steamed them in the instant pot (1 C water in the bottom, then place potato chunks on the steamer basket) for 15 minutes on the steam function then  natural release for 15 minutes.
2. Remove steamer basket and most of the water (leave a few Tbsp). Mash.

3212,l45knb,PlantBasedDiet,"Hello all!

I have been eating a WFPB diet for a little over 2 years now. I have been amazed by the positive changes I have experienced and I would like to help others achieve the same. I believe it would be a meaningful endeavour for myself and something I am excited about.

I want to learn what the transition is like for people. I have my own experience but want to know what it was/is like for others so I can best help where it is needed.

What challenges did you face? What could have made it easier? Where/how did you lapse? What did your social support look like?

A bit about what I am looking to do:

* A paid coach/teammate/cheerleader/friend for 3 months to help start the habit of eating WFPB.
* Only looking for 3 - 4 people at a time, want to be available
* Only looking for people who can afford it upfront, both in time and money ($1275 CAD per month, 3 month minimum - $3825 total)
* What do you think of the price point?
* Can setup free meeting to see if we are compatible before purchase
* Options for people to overpay for the service (pot-committed psychology hook)
* Program consists of phone calls, video chats and texts over the 3 month period starting with an introductory call to learn about client and then meetings over the 3 months to help with switching the pantry over, meal planning, engineering your success, emotional support, and Goals to reach - 3 days WFPB, 3 weeks WFPB, and a 3 month WFPB gradutation, etc.
* The program is designed for a switch to a 100% WFPB diet for the 3 months, not gradual transitions. It's how I did it and I think theres a beautiful positive loop I want to get people stuck in - eat better, feel better, bc feel better want to eat better.
* I am looking for the following values in clients - commitment, open &amp; honest communication, growth mindset.

I have a website launched with more detail - though it is still a work in progress. Not sure if I should link it or not, so if you're intrested in checking it out I can send you the link. Would love feedback.

Personally, I am excited to experience helping people change their diet. I think it will be the first step for myself into a more meaningful endeavour. If I really like this I can picture starting a charity or non-profit dedicated to trying to help everyone and anyone change their diet.

I appreciate your time and opintion!

If anyone would be willing to have a phone call and discuss your point of view further, I would love to do so!

I've known for a while now that I have not been operating to my full potential. I work for myself and I've documented the amount of hours I've spent in front of my computer in comparison to the amount of hours worth of actual work I've done and its pretty frightening. 

I now want to move away from processed foods. I eat a lot of it on a daily basis and my understanding is the vast majority of these foods cause inflammation which in turn causes brain fog. This leads to my procrastination and me not working anywhere near my capacity. 

The other thing for me is that I'm really active and I do have higher protein needs than the average person. 

I'm almost 90kg now, still very lean and do CrossFit 5 times per week with some extra bodybuilding sessions in there too. I consume around 120-140g of protein daily but I fail to understand exactly what food I can eat with this diet that will allow me to obtain this amount of protein. 

I'm the first to admit I moved to a vegan diet for health reasons, but multiple servings of mock meat, oreos on tap along with other biscuits and sweets most certainly isn't healthy. I'm ready to cut out all the shit now and really focus on my health.

3280,l0pyz9,PlantBasedDiet,"I went PB \~15 months ago. I have cooked at least six days a week / three meals per day for my family of four.

I started taking my six year old to therapy last year. He was such a good eater his first couple of years. He would eat all of his vegetables and grains and hated when I served a lot of meat. He is actually the reason I looked into going plant based in the first place.

Before I switched to cooking PB, I cooked strictly \[protein\] \[non-starch vegetable\] \[carb\] because I was really into macros and lifting. The protein was always meats, eggs, yogurts. 6yo always gladly ate the vegetable and carbs but didn't like the meat. Anyway, this is how we ate nearly all of our meals for the first couple of years of his life. 

When I switched to PB, things got weird. Easiest PB foods to make are like bowls and soups and stews and casseroles and one-pot etc. Just everything altogether. My son would refuse to eat most of the time. When we had chili, he would skip dinner, he would then eat 3-4 bowls of oatmeal the next morning. I tried so many dished thinking he just didn't like the flavors. He was okay with pasta because that means it's just sauce and a vegetable on the side. So I started buying pre-packaged vegan food more often for him and his sibling. Things like chickpea nuggets, boxed mac-n-cheese, pre-flavored cereals, freezer burritos, frozen pizzas, etc.

So I f'ed up and started buying that junk food for him. His diet choices started getting worse. He no longer ""liked"" vegetables and fruit or oatmeal. He gained \~15 lbs in one year...at 6 years old.

I had several breakdowns about it because I think I was just in denial. Here I was, always promoting a healthy lifestyle, always bragging about my kids loving veggies; but behind the scenes I created an obese child. ^(He is my youngest, and if/when you have kids, you notice that your youngest will always seem younger than they actually are. At least that's how it works for me. After my second was born, my oldest looked like SUCH a big kid, even though the day before my second was born, I saw my first as a little baby still.)

We started play therapy once a week for him last year for many different reasons I won't get into bc it's not relevant. I told the therapist all of the issues we were having, including diet. After several sessions and other relevant information, he was diagnosed with having Sensory Processing Disorder. One of the effects of SPD is having your food touching. I was thinking 'no way is that going to help him start eating'. I ordered some plates with the dividers in them. I made a normal meal, like chili I think (this was \~three months ago), but I put it on the kids' plates in the dividers chili/rice/cornbread. Not a lot either because I didn't want to overwhelm him and have him get stressed that he has to eat \*all\* of that. Like magic, he ate all of it. His whole plate. I had not seen that happen in almost two years.

Since then, he has lost &gt;5 lbs in a few months. I stopped buying the vegan junk food again and now my fridge is full so I feel like I am finally full circle on this post. The PB recipes I use already are getting extremely old for everyone in my house. Here they are:

* pasta with spaghetti sauce or pesto, salad, garlic bread
* any soup/stew, cornbread or homemade bread, rice
* curry, naan, rice

\*TL;DR\* I need the best two to three part complete meal combination ideas for my family. Also, just getting this off my chest feels better. I like meals to be simple ingredients.

A couple weeks into December I got extreme fatigue. I mean struggling to get through the day and not really feeling like I was getting a good nights sleep. I got my complete blood count done in response. Everything was perfect. 

I spoke to my doctor about what other potential deficiencies it could be. She mentioned vitamin D. In response, I upped my intake of vitamin D from about 600 IUs to 5000 IUs. This noticeably improved my fatigue. However, i still suffer from bouts of it through the work day. Exercising daily helps jolt my system awake. 

It‚Äôs been an unfortunate experience, especially considering I eat to as close a perfect diet as I can. Smoothies in the morning packed with fruits/veggies/seeds. Lots of greens, tofu, rice and beans. Occasional snacking on nuts. I supplement my omega 3s, iodine, b12. 

Is there any possibility that some people need more vitamin D than others?

3306,kzt5gc,PlantBasedDiet,"So, my dad has always been eating like shit. He grew up being that kind of guy who can eat whatever he likes and stays super slim - so he fed himself on a diet of very cheap bread and ham. He was quite proud about only spending like 5‚Ç¨'s a week on food - by literally eating the same shit every single day every single week.
This changed once he met my mum, who loves to cook (and actually understands the importance of eating whole foods, however she is still very much into traditional german cuisine aka meat) he got pretty fat quite quickly. Anyway, 20 years later and unfortunatley my mum is suffering from a disability now that makes it very hard for her to do even basic stuff, so her cooking has been degraded towards making noodles&amp;potatoes without anything. What my dad therefore used to do is to eat her potatoes with ham &amp; cream cheese - lots of cream cheese. Like 250g a day. However, he did his blood work some time in his late 40s and turns out (who would have guessed it) his cholesterol is through the roof.

I have been quite concerned about this, as my mother is already struck my disability and I really don't want my father to die early off an heart attack, so I made sure to praise to him the gospel of the whole food plant based diet. Being sceptical at first, he started replacing his cream cheese with ready-made-hummus etc. However, he lacks any understanding about nutrition and is refusing to do so. I can relate to that, he works in a very interlectually demanding job so in his free time he prefers not to read at all, however he somehow now believes that all the benefits I have told him about are from eating VEGAN and now from eating WFPB. I was okay with that, like eating vegan would still reduce his risk of heart attack, and I did not pay much thought as he was already hard enough to convince that he would not die of protein deficency once he quit his cream cheese. (To say, it also quite helped that I went from being overweigth myself to becoming&amp;looking quite fit after adopting a WFPBD, god praise Dr Gregor)

This christmas was great news. I managed to convince him of trying 2 months on a WFPBD (whole food plant based diet) and to get his blood work done afterwards to look for improvements.

I however underestimated how difficult it would be to convince him of eating the rigth stuff. He now replaced his cream cheese with the store-made-hummus (which is junk food tbh, it is like 50% oil) and his ham with vegan burgers (which are also junk food tbh) and than snacks potatoes with it.

He has grown up for 50 years, learning that a meal consists of something like poatoes or noodles or bread and MEAT and now I want to tell him that something like a salad with kuskus and tahini dressing is a whole meal? Additionally, he is super busy with his work (which I am quite grateful for, like honestly my mother can not work at all nowadays but he still makes enough money to finance a comfortable life for myself and our entire family while taking very little for himself) and does not know anything about cooking (and quite frankly, does not care - like if my mum is not here he goes back to his diet of cheap bread &amp; ham) and my mother is definitley not able to help as she unfortunatley can not do much more than cook potatoes or so.

I am afraid that while he eats now healthier than before (I mean, ready-made hummus is still better than cream cheese) he definitley wont see huge improvements in his cholesterol etc. and might just switch back to his old diet (aka "" its all in the genes anyway, i can not do shit"")

Dr. Guy Abraham, MD reporting on his clinical finding says, ""Most patients on a daily intake ranging from 1,250 to 5000 mcg of elemental iodine reported higher energy levels and mental clarity"".

3346,kxzt5u,PlantBasedDiet,"I understand that a true WFPB diet means no oil, cooking sprays, etc. -- and I understand the rationale for it (although embracing super-processed foods like tofu confuses me).

What I'm wondering is, how common is it really to give up oil 100%? Out of the 167k people in this forum, how many do you think have a kitchen with no oil?

I've personally tried ditching oil several times and lasted less than a week each time.  It made me less excited about cooking and I found myself not looking forward to meals. I know it's probably because I'm addicted to oil from the standard American diet ... but I just can't fathom ditching oil permanently. The pasta sauces, salad dressings, and condiments I love all include it.

I've got solid non-stick pans, but squirting water in them just makes me sad. Also I HATE the taste of vegetable broth. And so many WFPB recipes say, ""just use vegatable broth, it's great!"" I also bought an air-fryer to reduce my oil intake, but things only come out good in it if I add 1+ tbsp of oil.

For those who have given oil up completely, do you miss it? Does the addiction really go away after weeks or months? Do you ever eat takeout or go to a (precovid) restaurant? I can't think of one restaurant in my city where I could get a guaranteed no-oil meal.

It was a big blow for me mentally as I am generally a very active guy and do exercise regularly and used to take care of my diet in a reasonable way .

Currently I am put on aspirin, clodiprogal as part of dual anti platelet therapy , beta blockers , blood pressure medication and rosuastatin .

* green goddess dressing from Healthspan Solution (the one that goes with the Flourish Bowls)

So, to give a little context, I'm 5'6"" and 115lbs, and I not only suffer from PCOS (meaning I really should avoid grains/gluten), but I'm also lactose intolerant.

I've been working to eat as clean as I possibly can, and I've really developed a love for veggies. I much prefer eating smaller things more frequently rather than having large meals, but because most of what I eat only consists of raw veggie salads and fruit, it's hard for me to meet my daily 2000 calorie goal without eating *constantly*.

That being said, I've started to add 1 cup of peanuts to my daily diet since they're rich in protein and calorie-dense, making it much easier to meet my 2000 calorie goal. However, I know they also have a lot of fat in them, so I'm wondering if that might not be so good for me in the long run? I've tried doing some googling, but I didn't find anything too negative about them/anything saying that I should eat fewer, so I guess I'd just like some confirmation on that or not. Any additional advice would also be greatly appreciated!

Thanks again, and take care! :)",Too many peanuts..?

Hi everyone! I hope you all have been enjoying your break!
I am working on a project about plant based eating and am looking for people who are vegetarian, vegan, pescatarian, and plant based to share their stories about their journey to changing their diet and lifestyle. Some specific things can include but are not limited to: the reason/aha moment for choosing this diet, the reaction for your parents/peers from this new diet, the impact you want to make on the food system/sustainability/animal rights, religious significance, health benefits, your upbringing/background, etc.
There are no restrictions to this writing piece (just write about anything you want related to your plant based journey) and I encourage you to be as detailed as possible.

3673,khpu1c,PlantBasedDiet,"I'd like to get input from the community on tracking calories versus letting your instincts guide your food intake.

If we're eating WFPB no oil -- is calorie tracking necessary or even helpful?

My thoughts are that, based on everything I've read from experts in the field, palatability increases our drive to eat. When we manipulate food tastiness to be less, research shows that it can dramatically reset our hunger cues.

The cold, plain truth is that the ultimate tastiness trifecta of fat, salt, flour/sugar (I'm regarding flour and sugar as one), all increase the palatability of food which triggers the pleasure centers in our brains leading to overeating and lack of feeling satiated. 

When we remove one of those elements from the trifecta of ultimate palatbilty -- the lowered palatability of food and trigger our brain as much -- allowing our brains to calm down and rationally intake food as needed.

For example, when I eat pizza without dairy cheese (so removing fat from the ultimate trifecta of fat, salt, sugar/flour) -- it's just not as pleasure-inducing. It's mildly tasty with just the sauce and veggies, but it's not hitting my pleasure center the way the standard American diet (SAD) pizza does. 

The palatability isn't as intense. 

So, it's far easier for my brain to say, *Hey you're full and you can stop now* on WFPB pizza than SAD pizza. SAD pizza encourages me to just keep addictively eating.

I'm proposing that if you're eating a standard American diet of mixed hyper-palatable foods, calorie counting might make sense because SAD food is so palatable it highjacks your brain. 

But with WFPB food, because the ultimate trifecta of palatability is disrupted, it's not necessary to count calories, because your brain is allowed to not be triggered, to calm down, and to accurately indicate satiety.

Do you feel this is accurate? What are your thoughts?

When I was a ""string bean"" as my parents called me in High School, I was 190lbs.  


A couple years ago, I dropped \~40lbs in 60 days for a bet, and I did it with Keto when I was still ignorant to WFPB.

Sometimes I'd forget to eat all day.

Needless to say, today I am much wiser, and I have two kids, so Keto is not happening. But, I did learn a lot about myself doing it.

Fast forward to now, I need to drop some weight again (surprise surprises). I've been a vegan (admittedly junk food) for the last couple years. I've tried several times to go WFPB but what I notice is that I never really feel satisifed.

I go through the day \_pining\_ for something fatty. I end up relying on will power and by that point I realize I've already lost. I would eat an avocado and a handful of nuts and its like my brain switched back on.

3879,k5yho0,PlantBasedDiet,"I think the title of the article implies that eating if you don't eat dairy, meat or eggs that you will run the risk of having weak bones (which I don't think is true).

A large percentage of the people that don't eat meat, dairy or eggs do it because they're concerned about animal cruelty and climate change (not their own health).  As a result, they end up eating a diet of pop tarts, doritos and mountain dew (which is not healthy).  It's not a surprise to me that a lot of those people have bone density problems.

I searched around on google to find an article on ways to increase bone density that explains what I'm talking about:   [wikihow:  How to Increase Bone Density](https://www.wikihow.com/Increase-Bone-Density)

It basically says:


* Eat a diet that includes sources of calcium (soy, beans, peas, nuts, seeds, leafy greens, etc.)
* Get lots of vitamin D (fortified almond/rice milk, take a supplement or get in the sun)
* Get lots of magnesium (nuts, leafy green vegetables, whole grains, legumes, avocados, etc.)
* Get lots of vitamin B (take an inexpensive supplement once a week)
* Get lots of vitamin C (citrus fruits, red and green peppers, tomatoes, kiwifruit, strawberries, etc.)
* Get lots of vitamin K (green leafy vegetables such as spinach, kale, broccoli, and collard and turnip greens, nuts, fruits such as berries, grapes, and figs)
* Get lots of vitamin E (seeds, nuts, plant oils, spinach, broccoli, kiwifruit, mango, tomato, and spinach)
* Limit amount of caffeine and alcohol
* Do 30 minutes/day of cardio exercises
* Do resistance training (lift weights)
* Do plyometric exercises (jumping)
* Don't smoke


You don't need meat, eggs or dairy for any of those.  I take a vitamin B supplement once a week, get lots of sun and exercise and so I'm pretty sure I don't have to worry about having weak bones.

3927,k32zet,PlantBasedDiet,"I have.  First bone fracture in my life.  Funny enough, I saw both Neal Barnard and Dr Greger address this recently because a recent study came out that said vegans are a lot more likely to have bone fractures than omnivore.  A lot of it, it turns out, is that vegans have a lower BMI.  That means less stress on their bones, so they don‚Äôt get as strong.  Excuse me for being lean and beautiful (tosses hair).

But even when you control for BMI, vegans are still more likely to have bone fractures.  They have about 15 more bone fractures per 1000 people versus meat eaters, whereas vegetarians only had about 3 more cases.  They suspect this could be attributed to calcium deficiency.  I skimmed the study, and they suggested taking calcium supplements *with Vitamin D suppplements* could ameliorate the deficiency.

Spouse and I have been WFPB for almost two months now.  We did almost an overnight switch.

When we first made the switch neither of us had any issue with gas. But just in the past week we're both struggling with gas after eating beans.  Google says the gas should diminish with time, not that it would just suddenly start after six weeks. Does anyone have any experience with this? An idea as to what the cause might be?  

We're closer to 95% than 100%, but the foods we're eating that aren't compliant aren't veering right off course.  We've gotten take out a few times from a vegan place that uses olive oil. My husband gets the been burger and fries, so he gets more oil than I do since I get a grain/veg/bean/tempeh bowl and make my own dressing.

3951,k207yb,PlantBasedDiet,"I posted here about a year and a half ago about my wife‚Äôs successes with our WFPB diet and I wanted to give an update. 

She ended up being progression-free for a year and a half on her last treatment, and the average for that treatment is 7.8 months. We were obviously bummed to see it return, but being on the far right of the bell curve is still something to be happy about. 

Now she is in a clinical trial for an exciting new drug. The side effects are apparently pretty serious, and there are only five participants so far who have been placed on a full dose. My wife is one of them. She just finished her one month mark and went in for blood work, where she was told she is the only one able to tolerate the treatment. The main side effects are nausea and a lowered white blood cell count. Her WBC count did drop some, but not into the danger zone and is improving with every blood test (one per week). She is also prone to nausea but has had hardly any. 

She wasn‚Äôt scheduled to see any doctors, just the PA, but 5 ended up coming into her room quizzing her on everything she is doing, wanting to figure out what is different about her. They are finally interested in what she is eating! The head MD/scientist told her he‚Äôs putting 15 doctors on her case that she can contact at any time, and told us we are going to become like family. They want to know everything she does in life. I‚Äôve read stories about new breakthrough treatments and that first patient that proves that the drug works. We were joking from the beginning of the trial that maybe she could be one of those stories, but now it almost feels like it‚Äôs possible. We just read ‚ÄúWhy We Sleep,‚Äù and have been putting a greater emphasis on good sleep, but we really attribute her health to the WFPB diet. We‚Äôve seen so many positive health changes in her, me, and the few family members who have started to eat this way to believe otherwise. It‚Äôs like we have a secret weapon, but the only reason it is secret is because most doctors don‚Äôt want to hear about it. Maybe this will help put another crack in that wall. 

PS: I was surprised, especially for this subreddit, at some of the negative responses that I got when I posted about this a year and a half ago, of people accusing me of raising others‚Äô hopes when this may not work for them. So I want to say upfront that this is anecdotal evidence only. Obviously. When it comes to cancer, there is nothing we know of that will cure every cancer. If there were, we wouldn‚Äôt still be dying from it. But the evidence of the benefits of this way of eating seems to be way more compelling than most doctors give it credit for, which is why we have subreddits like this to begin with.

My family and I have been testing to eat a lot more fresh vegetables. The trouble I have is that I run out of space in the fridge. Between the dairy, condiments and ferments, my fridge gets stuffed to the gills. I don‚Äôt have room for a larger or secondary fridge. 

I already store onions, potatoes, garlic, and citrus out of the fridge now, so I‚Äôm doing good there.

For us, the in fridge items tend to be: cabbage, lettuce, carrots, celery, bell peppers, hot peppers, mushrooms, parsnips, kale, zucchini, summer squash, grapes, berries

4021,jya2g1,PlantBasedDiet,"Hello plant based community!  


I‚Äôm Dan, developer of [The Scientific Meal Planner](https://scientificmealplanner.com/), and I‚Äôve just launched a major update!   


If you haven‚Äôt heard about it yet, this is a tool which utilizes the latest nutrition science to generate extremely healthy meal plans. You‚Äôre probably aware that science points towards a whole food plant based diet being optimal for health and longevity. This tool reflects that reality.  


The meal plan generation algorithm is based on information presented on nutritionfacts.org, which I believe to be the most trustworthy source of evidence based nutrition information. What it currently does is analyze a recipe‚Äôs ingredients (down to the gram) and combine recipes in such a way that every day of the meal plan satisfies (or nearly satisfies) [nutritionfact.org‚Äôs daily dozen](https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2018/03/metric.png) foods you should incorporate into your diet daily.  


The latest update introduces a new recipe replacement system that lets you choose from recommended replacements. This gives you almost total control over how your meal plan is built, so you can be sure to get something that you find appealing. It also adds a favorite system to keep track of your favorite recipes.  
If you‚Äôve been following the project, you‚Äôd know that[ I launched it 8 months ago as a 100% free public service attempting to survive off of donations](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/fj0mi9/i_built_the_scientific_meal_planner_and_its_100/). This route has unfortunately proven unsustainable financially. I thought long and hard about how to restructure this in a way that supports my mission to accelerate healthy diets while sustaining my ability to continue developing the site.   
The result is a premium version that costs $7.99/mo and unlocks convenience features including calorie control system, recipe replacements, shopping lists, and nutrient breakdowns. The WFPB recipe creator community is an essential part of The Scientific Meal Planner, and thus **half** of all premium subscription revenue will go directly to our recipe creator partners. Every recipe in the site comes from our partners.  
It is my hope that this premium version can foster a healthy WFPB ecosystem so that myself and recipe creators can both keep working to spread the word about the benefits of a whole food plant based diet.  
**There remains a 100% free version** that gives you healthy meal plans. Nothing is held back in terms of the meal planning algorithm. You just don‚Äôt get the convenience features unless you upgrade to premium. This strikes the right balance between my original vision and the financial realities of developing a web app full time.

This is an ongoing project that will be continually developed as new science becomes available. You can expect the introduction of further factors into the algorithm making the meal plans even healthier. It is intended to be a resource for all who care about applying the scientific evidence to live longer, healthier, happier lives. Consider supporting our work!  
In health,

This could mean not eating the veggi burger.

TLDR: I try to get as much protein as possible, still hungry and exhausted. What gives? 

Backstory: I grew up eating lots of meat, but dinner was always veggie, carb, and a meat. Pretty healthy upbringing but after college I started to go vegetarian and I‚Äôve been on-and-off plant based for the past three years. 

When I do find myself committing to plant based, I am constantly exhausted. My energy feels like it spikes and crashes and at about 3 PM, I can hardly stay awake. I know that I should see a doctor about this - and that‚Äôs exactly what I did! She sent me to do bloodwork and I came back hypoglycemic. I am mid-twenties, very healthy, 5‚Äô 7‚Äù/145 pounds, I do hot yoga and spin classes about 4x a week. No other health problems in life, thankfully. 

So I go back to my doctor and basically the only thing she tells me is ‚Äúeat more protein‚Äù. I explain that I‚Äôm trying to cut out animal proteins and she tells me to eat fish. She clearly didn‚Äôt understand so I didn‚Äôt bother fighting her. I said thanks and haven‚Äôt been back since. 

I did try eating meat again for about a week, and I felt great. Less hungry, less peckish, more energy. I stopped again though for environmental/ethical reasons. Back to being tired and hungry. 

A normal day for me looks like:
1. Chia seed pudding with fruit, almond butter, coconut shavings, coffee w/ almond or cashew milk
2. Snack - apple or something of the sort
3. Lunch - big salad of some variety with protein (tofu or edamame) 
4. I have a sweet tooth - something in the middle of the day (homemade granola/energy bars)
5. Dinner - some source of protein (chickpea, tofu, beans), carbs, and lots of veggies normally 
6. A smoothie if I‚Äôm still hungry, or some kind of snack 

I eat between 1600-1800 calories per day. In high school, I was restricting to 1000-1200 so this is a step in the right direction for me.

I started eating a whole foods plant based diet about mid 2018 a few months after I had a ""minor"" health scare. Im a 26 Year old male who is about 5'8 and for most of my life I have been either a little heavy for very heavy (heaviest was 357 pounds before I changed my diet and I stayed around 330-350 for almost 10 years before hand and my blood pressure was generally around 125-138/80-85. I was sedentary and my diet was absolutely atrocious especially in the months leading up to my health scare. After the health scare I was having issues (chest pain) and went to see a ""doctor"" who in reality was a nurse practitioner who I still hate to this day. I go to this guy because I was having chest pains after my scare and I get a blood test before I can even see this guy and when I do see him he tells me im too young to possibly have a heart problem and it's probably just acid reflux and tells me if im worried I should try to lose some weight and lower my cholesterol  or else he would put me on a statin just in case (my total was 200+ at the time and my LDL was 166) he also tells me to change my diet abit to help my ""acid reflux"" which I do but it doesn't help my on and off chest pain in the slightest and I kept going to him asking him to please refer me to someone who can actually test/help me but he refuses and keeps trying to convince me it's just acid reflux and that it might just be some sort of stomach issue so he tests me for H. Pylori. That test comes back positive and Im put on antibiotics( big doses as well) two weeks along with an acid reducer and that had to of been the worst two weeks of my life, my chest pain got worse, I could barely sleep, I could barely eat and I was so stressed from not knowing what was actually wrong with me I couldn't sleep (this piece of shit GP never tested me again for H. Pylori again after to make sure it was gone). This whole time they kept trying to get me to meet with some psych guy due to my stress and anxiety that was caused by my GP in the first place and instead of trying to be helpful or understanding they kept trying to shove anti-depressants down my throat and essentially tell me I was just crazy (Honestly this whole ordeal was enough to make me consider suicide for the first time in 10+ years cause I felt absolutely helpless.)  Shortly they set me up with a nutritionist and they recommended some different diets to me and tried ""keto"" and learned more from ""Dr"" Berg and other Random nobodies on youtube and tried the diet as well as anything they'd recommend and well that didn't work out because I could still hardly eat and ended up in the hospital again due to my potassium being so low it was causing symptoms. 


After that I stopped the keto thing right away found some Vegan youtubers who talked about WFBP and watched and learned and then watched Forks Over Knives and was convinced to try this out and started doing to cold turkey cut out all the animal products, stayed away from the vegan junk food (most of the time id still have some like once every months or something) and the switch was pretty easy since I was considering going vegan before my health scare anyway and it worked fairly well. I was having regular bowel movements again, I had more energy, I was dropping the weight like crazy (I started at 357 and by the end of 2019 I was 230 and im currently around 220) My total cholesterol went from 200+ down to 160 and my ldl was 110 and that was when I was still at around 290-300 I believe so it's probably even lower now. my blood pressure lowered down to around the 115-75 range and even a bit lower when laying down. I was still having some pain and whatnot every now and then but it was much less until around late 2019 I think around early September when I was went for my daily walk and suddenly started having a bit of trouble breathing and semi collapsed, got sent to the hospital where they did an EKG and an xray, some blood work and found nothing. After that I went to see a new GP and this time they sent me to see a cardiologist and not only did I have to wait a month to see the cardiologist while having bad chest pain and all kinds of other problems again I had to wait ANOTHER month for the tests which were an ultra-sound of the heart and a stress test (which had to be stopped early because my pants kept falling, hilarious I know) and when I finally got to see the cardiologist he said exactly ""Well I dunno what's going on but you're 25 so im sure you'll be fine"" and this guy was supposed to be one of the best where I live... and since then I've stuck with the diet, Whole grains, Legumes, Fruits, Veggies, no oil, no added sugar, minimal salt, I try to walk every day (i've tried doing weight training as well but even light training makes me bedridden for a day or two now) I take my B12, I take D3, I try to get enough sleep I try to do everything I can but my body feels like it's shutting down and my chest pains are back. Im now getting blood pressure readings of 105-95 over 65-50 and it sometimes even dips lower to 80/40when laying down(my blood pressure use to be 95/58 laying down when I felt good) hell i even got a reading of 68-39 and I don't know what's going on my blood pressure is all over the place, my heart rate can fluctuate, sometimes im in the 50 to low 60's resting and sometimes it's up to 75+ resting. I can feel my heart beating damn near all the time, I back is chronically sore especially the upper left side, Im getting gastrointestinal issues again im constantly gassy even with low fiber intake, i feel weak all the time, I don't get restful sleep even when i get 7-9 hours, my mouth feels constantly dry I just don't know what to do. I try to do my best to hit the RDA's on everything to the best of my ability on 150$ a month of food stamps plus some and I generally do just fine  but I feel like im getting worse, I don't want to stop I want to keep eating this way I want to be healthy but im so lost and confused I dunno what to do I can't find anyone who can help me medical professional or otherwise because they all just say ""Well you're young you'll be fine"" and not do anything to help but im not im losing my fucking mind feeling like im slowly dying. It hurts to eat now so now im eating even less which can't be good but I just can't force food down my stomach even if its blended up in a smoothie or something. Im at my wits end and if I can't get help soon i probably wont make it to 2021...",I think I may have been and currently am doing this wrong.

Th only meals I can think of is plain oatmeal, baked potato with blended chickpeas as a sauce, and plain rice with blended chickpeas. Besides adding beans and legumes and sides of plain vegetables. 

I think bananas are okay so banana smoothie too. I used to occasionally make a green smoothie, but the other fruits are a no go (I specifically liked bananas &amp; mango). I just am not sure how much banana only smoothies I will be able to eat!

I think it‚Äôs fine to add ground flax or ground chia seeds even though they are fatty foods (harder to over eat). I am hoping the soluble fiber in it will help not irritate my throat.

I need to do this diet for 2 months and my brain certainly will not function well with that lack of caffeine so I appreciate any ideas to add. I already know it‚Äôs going to be bland, but most GERD stuff I‚Äôve seen include lean meats &amp; processed bread. I don‚Äôt want to buy a GERD cookbook and not be able to use 90% of the recipes.

4135,jsggjh,PlantBasedDiet,"Hi everyone,

I'm new to this community, and I could really use some advice. 

I'm a 23 year old girl, and I've been about 30-40 pounds overweight for pretty much my whole adult life. I have major problems with overeating that I can't seem to solve, and it's gotten worse since I finished college. 

I'm basically addicted to sugar, and I constantly overindulge on greasy and processed foods. I don't drink soda, but I make up for that by stuffing myself with candy and sweets. Even when I eat healthy food, I always eat way too much. I have no idea what ""satisfied"" or ""comfortably full"" even feels like. If I'm not absolutely stuffed after a meal, I feel like I have to eat more. Then, I eat more and end up stuffed and miserable. 

I really want to overhaul my whole diet and start eating healthier, plant based foods, with maybe some fish and eggs here and there. I would also like to limit myself to around 1,500-1,700 calories a day. Right now, I probably eat around 2,500-3,000 calories a day, but that's just an estimate. I try to count calories throughout the day, but I always end up binging on candy or junk food and basically just saying fuck it. 

I think a big problem for me is my surroundings. I live in the Midwest, in a town where there are very limited plant based options. Most of the restaurants are fast food, burger, or pizza places, with a few breakfast diners. We have a couple healthier restaurants, but they are much more expensive than the fast food places. 

In fact, my father actually happens to own one of the local breakfast diners, so I work there. Most of the food that we serve (and that I enjoy eating) is very heavy, greasy breakfast food that has about a 85% chance of being smothered in gravy. Most things on the menu have meat, cheese, or are deep fried. We have very few vegetarian options and zero vegan entrees. Don't get me wrong, the food is delicious, but I know it is also terrible for me. But since it's my family's place, I get to eat there for free, so it seems financially stupid not to take advantage of the free food. Not to mention, I work five days a week and have to be at work early in the morning and am there until lunch. So I end up eating most of my meals there. 

To top it off, we have some really kind regular customers who are constantly bringing donuts and baked goods for us employees, and if feels rude to refuse. 

I often try to buy produce to cook healthy meals at home, but usually one of two things happens. 1: I have no energy to cook, so all the vegetables I bought end up wilting in a couple days, or 2: I try to cook a healthy, planted based meal, but end up disliking it and being unsatisfied. 

My family is also a big concern for me. My mom's side of the family are a bunch of Midwestern hillbilly types (no offense) who eat something deep fried or covered in gravy for basically every meal. My dad's side of the family is Greek, and while they eat a little healthier, they also eat tons of meat and bread. Eating healthy in my family is almost frowned upon. If you try to eat plant based or eat less meat, or even just to eat healthy at all, you basically get judged and laughed at by both sides of the family.

My boyfriend is the other concern. He's a wonderful guy and I know he would probably support me if I wanted to change my diet, but I'm still nervous about how he'll react. One of the ways I love to show my affection for him is by cooking for him. On my rare days off from work, I always cook us a big breakfast with bacon, cheesy eggs (cooked in the bacon grease), toast, and butter. He always talks about how I'm such a good cook. Back before we met, on days that I didn't have work or class in the morning, I would always make myself a small, Japanese-style breakfast of an egg with a small amount of rice, and some miso soup. I'd love to go back to that, but I'm afraid of his reaction if I stop cooking us our big yummy breakfasts. 

Does anybody have any advice? At this rate, I feel like I am going to have to move to another state and start a new life if I want to get healthy.","I want to change my eating habits, but worried about how others in my life will react."
4136,jsfx2m,PlantBasedDiet,"Hey! I've read through the rules for this sub and noticed that it restricts ALL animal products from being considered ""whole foods plant based"". Why is this? And can anyone point me toward a whole foods plant based diet reddit that includes those of us who ARE plant based but not 100%?

When you wiki the definition of whole foods plant based diet it states: 
""A¬†plant-based diet¬†is a¬†diet¬†consisting mostly or entirely of foods derived from plants (including vegetables, grains, nuts, seeds, legumes, and fruits) and with few or no¬†animal-source foods""

Harvard states: Plant-based or plant-forward eating patterns focus on foods primarily from plants. This includes not only fruits and vegetables, but also nuts, seeds, oils, whole grains, legumes, and beans. It doesn‚Äôt mean that you are vegetarian or vegan and never eat meat or dairy. Rather, you are proportionately choosing more of your foods from plant sources.

Healthline: Nonetheless, the basic principles of a whole-foods, plant-based diet are as follows:

Emphasizes whole, minimally processed foods.

Limits or avoids animal products.

Focuses on plants, including vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, seeds and nuts, which should make up the majority of what you eat.

Excludes refined foods, like¬†added sugars, white flour and processed oils.

Pays special attention to food quality, with many proponents of the WFPB diet promoting locally sourced, organic food whenever possible.

Then when we look at the plant based doctors such as dr. Gregor and dr. Davis ect they use plant based when referring to say the adventist health study 2 to group vegans, vegitarians, and pescatarians together and do not mean 100% strict 

Dr. Campbell is 99% vegan
Dr. Mcdougall states he eats a turkey every 3 years
Dr. Dean ornishes reversal diet included low fat dairy AND egg whites and he has utilized fish oil omega 3
Dr. Valter longo says the totality of the research given his 5 pillar approach states that vegan + fish is the optimal diet according to the research (and he was up for a nobel prize)
Dr. Garth davis states according to all the research fish = green light 
Even dr. Gregor states that the plant based diet doesn't need to be 100% 
Dr. Kim Williams in a recent interview stated research shows egg whites have been cleared as good.

Personally I follow all the rules no salt, sugar, oil, I eat 90-95% whole foods plant based BUT include 5-10% of my daily calories from sea-food (no other animal products are bought or consumed). My fat intake is capped at 10% of my daily calories and saturated fat at 1%.

I discovered this sub back when I was first starting veganism but while the idea of a WFPB diet sounded great, it never seemed to leave me feeling full/satisfied (and not because I wasn't eating enough ... my portions were huge and left me uncomfortably ""full"" yet still hungry, dizzy and/or lightheaded).

1) Baking parchment. Something to do with juices not hitting the hot surface and evaporating straight away, apparently.

2) Using a mixture of root and juicy vegetables. In the photo he's used golden beetroot and onion wedges. Makes for a nicer (less dry) mouthfeel.   
3) Large chunks/wedges. If you chop it small, there's more surface area and more moisture evaporates.  
4) Leaving skins on where appropriate. Additional seal for that moisture.  
5) Basting. My partner does it once beforehand but could be worth doing multiple times during the roasting? He uses citrus juice. Would probably also work with water/veg or miso or mushroom broth/sherry/wine/soy sauce.

I took one Ezekiel sprouted grain tortilla (no oil, no sugar, no flour) and warmed it for 20 seconds in the microwave. Then, spread one half of the tortilla with some refried beans (I used Trader Joe‚Äôs fat free canned vegetarian refried beans, but they‚Äôre a bit high in sodium. You could just heat and mash your own pinto beans with spices for the same thing). Spread the other half with a tablespoon of cashew cheese - I used the store-bought brand nuttin ordinary, which is amazing. It‚Äôs literally just cashews blended with spices and probiotic cultures. Then, top the beans with some salsa. Fold in half and toast in a warm pan on each side until warm and a little crisped.

4254,jl8ekm,PlantBasedDiet,"I've been vegan over 3 years and mostly plant based for about 2, but I've never managed to kick my raging love of sugar and junk food for more than a week at a time. Just over a month ago, I finally said ""enough is enough"" and quit it all for hopefully good, and oh boy has my palette changed in that time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Normally I'd be the first to smash a whole packet of chips and dip at a party, followed by a roll of tasty biscuits then whatever other vegan snacks are running around. Sweet mixed drinks, all that jazz. Well now the same chips are too salty and burn my tongue, the dips are oily, slimy and sickening, the roll of biscuits leaves a nasty oily film on my tongue and throat, and even semi sweetened mixed drinks are just unpalatable. Instead, I'm staking out the dips platter and just snacking on all the veggies used for dipping (minus the dip). Even my preferred soy milk brand has become too sweet as I can taste all the added sugar, so I've switched to an unsweetened almond instead. Most processed foods are now becoming largely unpalatable, or at least unpleasant. 

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, I lust for fresh fruit, vegetables, and nuts. A fresh crisp apple, a banana just turned ripe. A punnet of chilled blueberries. A handful of unroasted peanuts. Chilled cucumber, cut into strips. Mangoes, oh lawd, mangoes. The ultimate smoothie sensation when mixed with banana, flax, oats and almond milk. Almost reminds me of cake batter sometimes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hadn't realised just how much of affect that routine junk food was having on my palette. The oreos, blocks of chocolate, takeaway chips, cheap white bread. Particularly the sweet stuff which I would definitely call myself addicted to.

A bit more then half a year ago I decided that I‚Äôm going to just go 100% and went vegan. Not a lot changed cus I didn‚Äôt eat much animal product after being plant based in the first place. 
I used to train twice a day, and just once on weekends (I am an MMA fighter. Some fitness in the morning, classes in the evening) and I felt fine and progressed with strength and fitness. 
For about the last 3-4 months I‚Äôve been just feeling dead. Finishing a class or a training session is hard and I run out of gas, muscles feel weak and burned after the simplest things. I wake up sore every single day and it influences my life. Brain fog. It‚Äôs horrible. 
I tapered my training now to once a day and it still is the same, constantly tired, sore, and weak. A big thing I noticed too is I feel my heart beating now like it‚Äôs beating harder or louder, something that I never noticed before. I went to the doctor a couple of times already and done blood tests and I am perfect. Low Cholesterol, good iron levels, electrolytes, hormones and test. Everything looked perfect, the doctor had no answer. Last time though my blood pressure was considered high but there was no mention of it after. 
I usually eat as follows: 
Breakfast - oatmeal with soy milk, hemp,chia,flax,walnuts and berries
Lunch and dinner are flexible but usually involve some starch, legumes, random veggies and leafy greens. 
I supplement with b12 and have a multivitamin everyday. I use creatine and sometimes I use protein.

4351,jdqdhh,PlantBasedDiet,"About five years ago I lost 50 pounds of 110 lbs I need to lose using a WFPB SOS free diet. I wasn‚Äôt perfect, but I adhered to it close enough to lose the 50 and have kept it off for almost 5 years now.  Yay me. 

The problem is that my ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù WFPB diet hasn‚Äôt been good enough to tackle the other 60lbs I still need to lose.  I‚Äôve just maintained at about 197 pounds. 

So I reluctantly see I can‚Äôt be making as many exceptions and just-this-once‚Äôs if i  want to get more weight off and keep it off.

4380,jc1x22,PlantBasedDiet,"Hi everyone, 

For the past 2 months, Dad has been in and out of hospital after a stroke in mid August. I realised it was time for him to switch his diet because in the past two weeks, his blood pressure has skyrocketed to 200. 

Although taking myriad of pharmaceutical medication, he went for a CT and MRI scan yesterday. Prior to this the appointment, his blood pressure was on average 150. Now during the MRI, they put something in the drip which made his body become extremely hot assuming this was for the procedure. Since the appointment, his body has been off and then last night BP rocketed to 217. Trembles and shivvers, weakness and lethargy. 

This truly was a smack in my face that despite all this medication, this shit was only masking if not reducing his symptoms and not curing shit. So an anomaly or something out of the ordinary can really just kill the man at any given point in time if he were to miss his medication or take something that might not agree with him.

These are calorie-matched comparisons, and as you scroll down to the vitamins, you can see this is not the case, as the oils have lost all their water-soluble vitamins, and despite being 100% fat often even lose out on fat soluble vitamins, with few exceptions.
