Of course everyone will have their opinion and choose their level of strictness for what they allow. 

Anyway enjoy the read and the recipe for fancy toast that she includes

4,r59uc9,PlantBasedDiet,"  I started a WFPB diet a month ago after I watched a lot of interviews with dr Barnard, dr Klaper, dr McDougall and I believe in their message, it makes a lot of sense. But since being on the low carb/keto bandwagon for a year I sometimes still hear the mantra 'carbs are the devil'. It doesn't help that I feel bloated, but still hungry, constantly thinking of food, I just feel like I am losing control.

Currently I feel like I am gaining weight, my hunger is insane, even though I eat till I feel full mostly vegetables, fruits, mushrooms, with a side of carbs, without nuts, oils, bread, pasta, sugar etc. As fats, I eat a tbsp of chia seeds, flax or pumpkin seeds.

I know it is too soon to expect to see results, it's only been a month, but to be honest I am terrified of gaining back weight. I still have at least 20kg more to lose to be considered  normal weight which is what I want. 

A (lot) of backstory: I have struggled with my weight all my life, I have been yo-yo dieting (from 45kg to my highest 98 kg in early 2020). That's when I started with low carb and intermittent fasting, transitioned to alternate day fasting and a vegetarian diet, still keeping pretty low carb. I lost 20kg in this time, but my weightloss has hit a plateau for almost 5 months and now I am constantly losing and regaining 3-5kg. Started going to a gym, working out for 1.5h to 2h 4-5 times a week. Not much improvement weight wise, or measurements, just an increase in strength. 

I decided to go WFPB which seems like the natural next step. I started this new lifestyle in late october. I also decided to stop alternate day fasting for now because I don't think i can manage to eat so many calories from a WFPB diet with no oil, low in fat. I eat a lot of veggies, mushroom, fruits, but I have a food intolerance which prohibits me to eat cashews, almonds and most tree nuts.

If you have any advice, reassurances, success stories, or not so successful ones, send them my way, they will be appreciated. Thanks for reading my long ass post.",Ex - low carb in need of advice,1

My sister and brother-in-law eat a whole food, plant based diet. However, my husband does not. Last year for Thanksgiving we hosted at my house. I had a lot of fun picking out new recipes and preparing a meal. It was 100% plant based. We have a rule at my house between my husband and I, that no matter what the other person cooks, you have to eat it. So if he cooks, I eat it or if I cook, he has to eat it. This made last year‚Äôs Thanksgiving enjoyable to me (maybe not so much to my husband) because I did all the cooking. I would say that we had a lovely dinner.

Also I need to note is that my husband is on the thin side. He has struggled for a long time to gain weight. He typically eats sweet potatoes and whole milk to try to bulk up (in opposition to eating junk food). He also weight lifts. Still he struggles to bulk up. He wants to consume animal protein to help with his weight gain. He is also from a culture where many traditional dishes are made with meat so it is also his comfort food. 

Fast forward to today and my sister is hosting this year. In the past, when we have visited my sister, it has been all plant based. This bothers my husband because he feels that when they visit us, we take a lot of time and consideration into making a meal they would like and he doesn‚Äôt feel that that is being reciprocated. If he brings his own meat dish, my sister won‚Äôt let him use any of her plates or silverware because the meat will ‚Äúcontaminate‚Äù them. This makes my husband feel disrespected, like he‚Äôs being treated like ‚Äúgerms‚Äù.

Literally every recipe I can find calls for oil. I guess that makes sense since it's a ""fryer"" so maybe this isn't good for an oil-free diet. 

I had layered veggies on the trays, but I might try another batch today in a baking dish where I can add a little water and a lid so there is some moisture. Get stuff cooked through, then take the lid off for the final roasting/browning part.

72,qtqm1o,PlantBasedDiet,"10 years ago, at my fitness peak, I went from a Mediterranean style diet to a WFPB diet. Didn't ease into it, just went for it. The 8 months I was on WFPB were the best I ever felt, the most energy I ever had. Sadly, my situation at the time made a Mediterranean diet much easier to manage and went back to it. 

Fast forward to 2020, I have been plagued with depression, IBS, Iatal Hernia, oesophagus ulcers from chronic reflux, and a few month ago, I landed in the hospital with acute pancreatitis. After reading on how to heal my pancreas, turns out meat fats are my enemy. So, 3 weeks ago, I went back to WFPB.

On the 3rd day, I was energetic the fog in my head was gone, I was physically able to sustain physical activity again. 3 weeks later, I have been working out 5 days a week, I am able to take on projects, I am upbeat. But through the whole diet change process, which I didn't ease into, I never once felt abdominal discomfort, lack of energy or any of the bad effects I should be feeling according to academic reviews.

I still have 2 vices; I drink 1-2 cappuccino daily and I smoke 1 cigarette daily. The latter which I entend to cut completely in the next few weeks. The former much harder since I love the taste of coffee so much.

So I would like to ask others who are on WFPB:

- Is this type of diet sustainable in long term? Specifically I am using Thrive as a guide, are there other good (or better) sources out there?  

- Do I have to forego coffee completely on this type of diet?

- Do I need to supplement? Is there specific supplements to provide what this type of diet might be lower in?

- What is the catch? Why do I feel so good from literally just changing overnight and don't have any negative effects, is this gonna last or is the bad going to catch up to me eventually?",WFPB experience and questions.,1

Seeing as how people commonly consume more than 10g of almonds at a time in snacks, almond butter, or as almond flour; I'd bet &gt;10g (say like eating 1/4 a cup or 1/2 cup) of almonds would probably par right up with 30.9g of flax (or surpass it) in terms of cyanide influence.

I always thought baked beans were only those super sweet, salty, canned variety that usually had bacon and lard in them and were served with ribs, hot dogs, and hamburgers at BBQs, next to the coleslaw, potato salad, and potato chips.

So, when everyone kept saying 'beans on toast' for breakfast ideas for this non-breakfast eating vegan, I was skeptical. Honestly, I thought it sounded disgusting. But, this morning I threw together some simple beans using a basic recipe I found randomly on the internet, tossed them on top of a bagel (the cat got into my whole grain, home made bread so that's all the bread I have right now), and took a bite. I haven't been this surprised since I tried tofu scramble and discovered how amazing that is (being a scrambled egg hater). 

My question is, does anyone have a hearty, healthy, cheap recipe? The one I used was kind of bland and sweet (called for molasses which is fine, but it literally lacked all other flavor). I like a little spice, a little salt, even a little sweet if its offsetting another flavor (such as sweet and spicy).

I'm looking for a few people who are dedicated to improving their health, nutrition and meal planning to trial something I've been working on. It's free and I just want some feedback so I could improve and make this accessible and useful for many others in the plant-based community.

After more than a year of development and many more before that idealising and thinking of how I can make it work to help me stay on top of my nutrition while living a busy life, I created an online app which generates plant-based meal plans automatically based on your personal fitness goals and nutritional requirements with the aim to save time and take the guess work out of healthy plant based nutrition.

For example, if you hypothetically extracted the sugar from an apple, would eating both the extracted sugar and the remaining sugar-less apple (simultaneously) be roughly as healthy as eating the structurally intact apple prior to the extraction, or would the latter be significantly healthier because its sugars are structurally bound to the fiber or micronutrients in some significant manner? And if the latter, how exactly does the structural integrity prevent the harmful effects of refined sugars/calories?

The practical implications of this question have to do with the safety of adding refined sugars to very high-fiber foods to increase their palatability. I understand that date sugar is the healthiest sweetener (followed by blackstrap molasses and probably jam), whole food is always better than refined food, it's fine to add a little sweetener if it helps you eat a healthy food you otherwise wouldn't, yada yada.

And I use oil to saute some of the ingredients. 


I know it's possible to saute without oil. I do it often. I also know that my wife screams at me when i saute ingredients that go into a pot of beans to make this been stew. I now use her favorite large pan and I didn't use oil in it for some time. 





I see her point, I pretty much destroyed this pan within a couple of months using it maybe 10 times. 




So for practical technological reasons I started using a small amount of oil. 3 table spoons to be exact.  It's this a small amount?  The amount of ingredients that I make for this stew make up about 6 quarts of stew. 



3 table spoons of oil in 6 quarts works out to be 1/8 of the tablespoon per cup or 15 calories of oil per cup.



For health concerns we are talking about less than 2 grams of oil per cup.




Sauteing with 3 tablespoons of oil makes the actual process so much easier and extend the life of the pan seemingly indefinitely, so to speak for practical purposes. It's a pretty high quality and expensive pan that comes with its own wood spoon.

It conveniently coincides with my first ‚Äúannual‚Äù physical exam in 2.5 years. I feel fine and always feel good about what I eat. This started with concern about rising LDL (bad) cholesterol levels and that has turned around (20% drop). And there are so many other benefits. Benefits to self and to the planet.

While it is often a challenge to eat out and find vegan options, there always seems to be something that works even if it is just a couple of side orders. I confess to still missing the taste of a few non-vegan foods, mostly cheeses, but the substitutes work out well enough for me. I have lots to learn to be a decent vegan cook but that will come with more practice.

I supplement daily with Omega 3 and a multi-vitamin. The multi has B-12 but my level has dropped and needs to be dealt with. While it seems that my diet does not include enough calcium, blood work says that is ok. Actually all is good except the B-12. The supplement says it has 667% of the RDA for B-12 but, apparently I need more.

I am fortunate that friends and family are very accommodating of my diet choices. Only one of my friends is vegan. With friends and family, we work it out if our time together includes eating.

I've been interested in plant based milks for a while and decided to try cashew milk, as I've heard almond milk was pretty watery and I was afraid it would put me off. I bought Silk unsweetened cashew milk, and I was surprised - I love it! Now since it's a whole ass carton of cashew milk and cashews are hella expensive I know that there can't be a heavy ratio of cashews to water and whatever preservatives are added to make it shelf stable for this price. I also noticed it has kind of an aftertaste, though it's not too bad.

I'm wondering if homemade cashew milk also has a problem with an aftertaste at the sacrifice of losing the shelf stability. All the recipes I'm looking up say that it's only good in the fridge for about three days, so I'm wondering if having a higher ratio of cashews to water would fix the aftertaste problem.

195,qdygr7,PlantBasedDiet,"For the past month and a half, I've been going through the process of switching to a WFPB diet. My father recently had a scheduled bypass surgery and there's a lot of heart disease in my family, and I want to take control of my health. Also, I've been increasingly uncomfortable about my cognitive dissonance of identifying as an animal lover yet still eating animal products. 

So far, the diet switch has gone quite well. I have much more energy and have experienced a notable lack of anxiety and fearfulness since starting this diet. I have eaten animal products 3-4 times over the past 6 weeks, but when I thought about doing it a few days ago when I was at a restaurant with poor vegan options, I was grossed out by the idea of animal products and chose to eat a weird vegan option instead. Unfortunately, I also suspect I have issues with gluten as well. In the spirit of brevity I won't go too much into it but I think I will need to have a gluten-free diet as well. 

So, onto my issue. Eating out is a big part of my life. My partner and I are fortunate enough to be able to dine out rather frequently. I live in a part of the U.S. where it is extremely easy to find vegan, gluten-free options wherever I go (though I have accepted that I will eat oil when I eat out; this is not a huge deal to me because I don't have any preexisting health conditions as of yet). However, we also travel quite a bit. In the past, we have celebrated big occasions at Michelin star restaurants, and we have traveled internationally fairly extensively. When (if?) the pandemic is finally under control, we will travel again. In the past, we have made food a central part of our trips. We love exploring a culture through its cuisine, and we typically order many different dishes and share everything. I mourn the loss of this social aspect. 

At home, I do the cooking. I have been meal-prepping quantities of chicken to add to his portion of the WFPB gluten-free meals I've made, and he's more than happy with that. He also recently purchased a grill, and he can learn to cook meat for himself to add to the meals I make. As recently as a few days ago, I thought that I would simply make exceptions to my diet when we go to a fancy restaurant that has a prix fixe menu without vegan options, or when we travel and there are no good options. I figured, a gluten-free diet *has* to be strict, because even a little bit can set off a months-long autoimmune response. But I could eat small amounts of animal products a few times a year without too much detriment to my overall health. 

However, the further I've gone down this path, the more I can't escape the fact that it is against my morals to eat animal products. I've done more research into the matter and I can't unknow what I've learned. I am starting to believe veganism is the only acceptable path for me. I think this is genuinely going to be a relationship hurdle for my partner and I when we travel again. He is a bit of a hedonist and just wants to live the ""good"" life and consume whatever he pleases. I'm sure he would feel better on a WFPB diet, but he doesn't suffer the same ill health symptoms I do; he can eat and drink to his heart's content and feel mostly good. 

I am not going to try to convince him to change his eating habits in any way. I believe the best way to lead is by example, so maybe he will alter his habits and ask questions if he sees my (hopeful) success on this way of eating. But if he doesn't, I won't push the point. He is very willful and will most certainly react to any pressure by doubling down on his position. Plus, I just don't feel that anyone else's consumption is my business. 

Is there anyone who has navigated a similar situation or can offer any advice? The main destination in my mind about this issue is Japan. The last time we were there, we ate ramen, sushi, Izakaya fare (lots of meat and dishes containing soy sauce, which unfortunately contains gluten), curries (usually not vegan and probably containing flour), and burgers. It's his favorite place in the world, and one of mine as well, and eating out is going to be a huge hassle for me, and by extension, for him. I wish he were more supportive but I also understand the annoyance that comes with having to alter a peak experience for yourself because of someone else's choices. I'm thinking this may, in some circumstances, come down to a choice between eating gluten (bad for my health) or animals (against my morals). I am asking for advice and insight here instead of r/vegan because I don't believe I would get any nuanced or empathetic responses over there.",Advice on navigating the switch to a WFPB and gluten-free diet with an omnivore partner?,1

I still looked up a lot of recipes and ideas so this weekend I plan on meal prepping and really trying to get serious about it. I recently learned my cholesterol is high, I have an elevated liver enzyme, I was put on blood pressure meds - not to mention the 70 pounds I have to lose. I really thought all of this would be enough to motivate me, and it did for awhile, but not enough. I have tried changing the way I eat on and off for years so I have become very, veeerry well-acquainted with my weak areas and downfalls. One of them is striving for perfection or nothing at all. So I've caught myself overthinking again.  

I am not a veggie person. Everyone's food pictures of fresh veggies and salads look so good and I want to like it too, but I just can't. I will eat green beans. I have no problem cramming a few cups of greens into a smoothie, so I've got that going for me. I can tolerate quite a few veggies if they're super soft in a stew or soup form. And of course, the starchier the veggie, the more I'm ok with it. 

I'm drawn to a lot of the black bean/sweet potato dishes, pastas with hidden veggie sauces, other whole grain meals. I do continue to try vegetables cooked in several ways but I will start gagging after a few bites. I will add onions, sweet peppers, etc. to things and I think I'm in the mindset of those not really counting as anything. Only the good green stuff matters. This all becomes very discouraging as I feel like my diet shouldn't consist of mostly grains, starches and legumes. However, again, I know I will fail if I don't like the food I'm eating. I also know that even if I start out with the meals I've listed it's still better than the alternatives I would be turning to. 

Am I wrong in some of my opinions? I'm still researching the ""rules"" of this way of eating. Should I not be worrying about this as much as I am? Will I be just fine with fruits, pastas, and massive green smoothies and vegetable stews? I of course will keep trying with the fresh veggies and hopefully my taste buds will adjust.",Food Balance,1

I‚Äôve been vegan for almost 3 years. My personal diet kind of flip flops between being a ‚Äújunk food vegan‚Äù to eating regular vegan to whole foods. I want to eat more WFPB for my overall health and for weight loss. 

However, I‚Äôm allergic to tree nuts. I avoid peanuts because I had a cross contamination reaction once. I also have to be careful about some seeds, especially ‚Äúbulk bin‚Äù type seeds since cross contamination is very high (and it‚Äôs hard to distinguish a sliver of almond from sunflower seeds when it‚Äôs all mixed up). I have anaphylactic type allergies to nuts, carry an Epi-pen, and I simply cannot budge or bend on eating nuts.

Being nut-free and vegan isn‚Äôt difficult in my day to day life. But I find *a lot* of WFPB recipes, meal ideas, and diet guides rely on nuts.

Sorry if thats a stupid question.
A few weeks ago I wrote a feedback comment to a vegan restaurant which makes plantbased handcrafted meals that seem relatively healthy.
I've eaten there a few times and I like their products but at home I only cook WFPB. I basically wrote them that I like their products but that they would be even better if they move more towards a WFPB direction.
They replied to me and basically agreed. They wrote that they ""process pressed oils only very sparingly and use only fresh, unprocessed raw materials.
Deep-frying, for example, is a no-no, but baking eggplant without oil is hardly feasible and leads to unconvincing results.""

And then they asked if I have any feedback for a specific product. 
I was thinking I could suggest that they make their hummus oil-free and, ideally, with not that much tahini so that it is low-fat. If they arent satisfied with how creamy the hummus turns out, they could consider skinning their cooked chickpeas to make the hummus more creamy, although that would require extra time and effort.
They also use a cashew-dressing &amp; a ginger-miso-dressing in some recipes. I could also suggest that, if its not already the case, they make those dressings without oils.

But other than that I cant think of much.
They use a vegan version of nutella, which I kind of dont dare to criticize because I cant suggest a WFPB alternative that seems feasible and affordable for a small company like that.

* https://us.oatly.com/products/full-fat-oatmilk-chilled

&gt;Oatmilk (water, oats), low erucic acid rapeseed oil. Contains 2% or less of: dipotassium phosphate, calcium carbonate, tricalcium phosphate, sea salt, dicalcium phosphate, DHA algal oil, sodium ascorbate (antioxidant), tocopherols (antioxidant), riboflavin, vitamin A, vitamin D2, vitamin B12.

The second ingredient ""low reucic acid rapeseed oil"" or in the US often called canola oil, makes a big impact.  Oats are 15% fat by calories food, hence it's milk should be the same.  Yet:

* 1 cup FF Oatly
* Calories - 160
* Fat - 9 g = 81 calories

If the drink were purely oats, one would expect 15% fat from calories, about 24 in this case but here it's 81 from the canola oil, making this a 50.6% fat by calories product.  Since the oat calories only compromise 79 calories, the oat fats tally to 12 calories and 69 will be canola oil, a little more than half a tablespoon in each cup.

268,pyhp2v,PlantBasedDiet,"2016. I was eating anything and everything, no matter the animal, no matter the source. My options were diverse, but so were internal problems that were facing me. Cystic acne, lethargy, anxiety were all crippling me. Until one day, I had to temporarily stop eating dairy as I was on acne antibiotics. Little did I know that this was a blessing in disguise! I had more energy and was feeling a lot less lethargic; very much like increasing the video quality of a YouTube video! Within 2 years, I made the transition to plant based eating and I haven‚Äôt looked back since! Here are some of the benefits that I‚Äôve harnessed with plant based eating.

**Better physical performance:** Being a sports and fitness fan, the differences in my performances before and after this diet is like night and day. My endurance has increased tenfold, I feel stronger and I am a lot more injury free. This is because dairy and meat products can increase inflammation in the body and joints, leaving us more susceptible to injury. Also, I am better able to recover from gym sessions and playing football matches and I suspect this is a direct result of there being less inflammation in my body. It‚Äôs not just me, some of the best sports athletes in the world such as Lewis Hamilton and Virat Kohli all follow plant based diets.

**Greater focus:** As I feel less tired and lethargic in the morning, it has helped to stay more focused throughout the day even without the help of coffee. As a result, I am better able to focus on work tasks and I complete them to a higher standard.

**Greater sense of well being:** Overall, I just feel a greater sense of lightness within myself. According to studies, meat products are harder to digest and can lead to constipation. However, with a plant based diet, you‚Äôll be getting more than enough fibre to ensure that this will never be a problem! With this lightness, I feel like I am more sensitive to food, as if my taste buds have become enhanced, better allowing me to enjoy the wide ranges of scrumptious plant based food that are available to me!

Transitioning to a plant based diet does not have to be immediate! Start by trying plant based options at restaurants, or having one plant based meal a week. The proof is in the pudding and I wholeheartedly encourage everyone to find out for themselves about these benefits! For it is truly accessible to everyone!

Now to add to the list of things I don't have to worry about are - finding potential bones/tendons/hard parts/weird body part chunks in my food (even fking meat burger patties would consistently have some hard/chewy disgusting parts); much less need to worry about food being undercooked or the particularly awful parasites found in meat/fish; no need to look into the whole diet/lifestyle of the animal to determine whether they are really grassfed, how much stress they have, if they get any hormone or antibiotic injections, etc. to determine if their dairy has good nutritional composition.

But there are studies Gregor himself points to that show that eating things like blue berries and spinach before even the unhealthiest high fat McDonald‚Äôs meal can almost completely mitigate biological markers for artery damage or whatever. There are compounds in meat like certain omega 6 fats that are associated with great health benefits that cannot be found at all in plant foods.

I think it‚Äôs also somewhat dishonest to say that eating a whole food plant based diet comes with no draw backs. A lot of these foods are hard to digest, contain anti nutrients, and things like oxalates which come with known health risks. I‚Äôm not knocking eating this way.

(I should mention I have binge eating disorder so eating for emotional reasons is a huge issue. I'm working to ""treat"" this but no treatment approach I've found or discussed with therapists addresses this particular issue).  


So, after a few days, I feel emotionally run down and will binge on something unhealthy but tastier (vegan junk food with added sugar/salt/oil).

I've come across some interesting things you can do to boost nutrition for various foods and I'm on the search for more that I haven't heard of yet. Thought I'd share what I've come across, see if ya'll can contribute any, and then I'll make some sort of list/graphic to share once I compile them all.   


Here's what I've got so far:  


* Pre-chop cruciferous vegetables to boost sulforaphane production
   * Sulforaphane is a beneficial phytonutrient found in cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, brussels sprouts, kale, collards, or cauliflower). Sulforaphane is created via a reaction triggered by chopping the vegetable. To maximize sulforaphane production, chop cruciferous vegetables 40 minutes before cooking. If frozen, this strategy will not work, but you can still boost sulforaphane production by adding some mustard powder to trigger the reaction.
   * Reference: [https://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/09/how-to-cook-broccoli/](https://nutritionfacts.org/2016/02/09/how-to-cook-broccoli/)
* Pre-chop or crush garlic to boost artery relaxing compounds
   * Garlic creates artery relaxing compounds via a reaction triggered by cutting or crushing it. To maximize production of these compounds, cut or crush the garlic ten minutes before cooking it.
   * Reference: [https://nutritionfacts.org/video/flashback-friday-inhibiting-platelet-activation-with-garlic-onions/](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/flashback-friday-inhibiting-platelet-activation-with-garlic-onions/)
* Black pepper boosts turmeric absorption
   * Adding black pepper to dishes containing turmeric can boost the absorption of the turmeric phytonutrient curcumin by 2000%.

I stumbled upon this great subreddit when I was looking to drastically change my diet up.

I ended up at about 130kg (286lbs) at 6"" and was dreadfully unhealthy. The whole keto/carnivore/lowcarb/justeatbacon method wasn't working and it was just an excuse to eat like a pig. So, the good news is that in a month im down 5kg and I've noticed a few things:

1. inflammation. it's gone! I used to blame those pesky carbs for bloating me up but looks like it was the meat. any links to this?
2. mood. I am calm, focused and have balanced energy. I seemed to live on the edge with constant anxiety whilst on a meat based diet - is this a drop in cortisol and a boost in serotonin from the carbs?
3. No bloating. what is going on? I assume that all these lovely plants have done wonders for my gut as I feel lighter and healthier. I'm gonna take a punt and say fibre! why is this wonderful nutrient ignored so much?

One thing though, my mum has been going off to see a man, so I‚Äôm often living on my own or at my uncles, and often she gives me pocket money to buy myself essentials and what not.. 

With this money I‚Äôve tried going grocery shopping, I got a few ingredients but not many, since I‚Äôm limited to my bike, but I constantly find myself making the same old recipes. What I have trouble with is buying efficiently and making meals out of all the food I buy (hoping it can last me more than a week) 

I am also quite busy all the time with my sport so I don‚Äôt have all the time to also cook amazing meals, right now it has come to me preparing a big batch of rice and then adding some frozen vegetables to it‚Ä¶ 

My mum says find a recipe and buy the ingredients for that, but I always feel like that‚Äôs such a waste and inefficient, and so I don‚Äôt know what to get in my situation. 

I don‚Äôt know how to cook well yet too.. 


This is the stuff I have right now, maybe there are some suggestions as to what I could add? 

- 2 things of hummus 
- 1 bunch of celery 
- 2 cartons of almond milk 
- 2 little boxes of mushrooms 
- a bag of frozen mixed peas, corn, etc 
- a bag of frozen Italian blend veggies 
- a bag of frozen berries 
- some whole wheat tortillas 
- a bag of avocados 
- a tub of cherry tomatoes 
-2 cans of chickpeas 
- can of mixed beans 
- bag of quinoa 
- bag of brown basmati rice 
- peanut butter 
- bag of red lentils 
- some whole grain macaroni 

And I think that‚Äôs it. 
I know it‚Äôs probably a lot, I just have trouble constructing things, and I‚Äôll look up recipes and the recipe will require more ingredients than I have, and it‚Äôs just frustrating I can‚Äôt bike all the time to the store, and I don‚Äôt have infinite money.

I joined a gym solely for the purpose of gaining muscle. This is a privately owned gym which does all forms of training. On the first day, the owner and operator who is also a trainer, talked to me. **BEFORE** he asked me what I eat, have any allergies or what my eating regimen was, he gave me a run down of things to **completely** get rid of in my diet. I thought it was pretty strange, because, other than sugar, I have never heard any of the other claims. Then he emailed me that information so I can reference it. I talked to my family doctor - who knows my health very well - and she said his nutrition guide sounded like alarmist bullshit. 

He says in order to gain muscle, you have to get rid of Soy, Dairy, Sugar, Gluten and Corn. 

Why? Because it makes your muscles inflamed. And inflamed muscles slow your gains progress. That was the jist of it.

Inverse associations were observed between the intake of apples and pears, citrus fruits, green leafy vegetables, cruciferous vegetables, and salads and cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality, and between the intake of green-yellow vegetables and cruciferous vegetables and total cancer risk. An estimated 5.6 and 7.8 million premature deaths worldwide in 2013 may be attributable to a fruit and vegetable intake below 500 and 800 g/day, respectively, if the observed associations are causal.

418,p6bl4g,PlantBasedDiet," The idea is to follow a daily high-protein goal and weekly calorie goal (21,000 kcal). This should be easy after following a daily ""shell"", constant staple foods, of about 100 g protein (including 40 g protein powder) and 1500 calories. This way, all one needs to do is count the calories and protein from lunch and dinner (instead of everything every day). Why? This is for weight-gain and bodybuilding. 

By ""shell"" I mean a morning snack, afternoon snack, evening snack and drinks. 

* 600 calorie breakfast
   * 20 g protein
* Ideally, 275 calorie peanut butter apple, morning snack
   * 7.5 g
* lunch
* Ideally, 250 calories 1/4 cup almonds + 7 apricot halves, afternoon snack
* dinner
* Ideally, 380 calories 1/2 cup walnut/ pecan night snack
   * 14.5 g (including almonds+apricots from the afternoon) 

600+275+250+380

\~= 1500 kcal

Drinks

* ~~120 OJ, 1 cup~~
* 250 soymilk, 2.5 cups
   * 17.5 g protein
* ~~150 grape juice, 1 cup~~
* ~~130 vanilla protein powder, 1 serving~~
* ~~150 chocolate protein powder, 1 serving~~

By only using the foods accepted on a WFPB diet, the shell equals 1750 calories and 59.5 g protein (vs 2300 calories and 102.5 g protein). So 550 calories and 43 g protein difference from the juice and protein powder. 

For a 3000 calorie, 160 g protein diet, this would mean lunch and dinner would have to be an average of 625 calories each. It's possible, but challenging to get that many calories (excluding the drink). 

Say one's daily protein goal is 160 g. That means, a 29 g protein average for each lunch and dinner would have to be bumped up to \~**50 g** protein per meal. Now that's a stretch. Most meals are 10-30 g protein. 

# Solutions

‚Üí larger breakfast (e.g., 1444 calorie smoothie)

‚Üí sip some blended drink throughout the day: for example, a 30 g protein soy milk perhaps with quinoa blended together

‚Üí different/larger morning, afternoon and evening snacks equaling 52 g protein total

‚Üí \~2 cups of soymilk more for breakfast and \~2 cups more for dinner (or lunch)

After the WFPB high-protein high-calorie shell is figured out, I'll try to make one for nut free, soy free, gluten free, keto friendly and maybe IBS friendly.

Hello there, im excited as i just met this subreddit a few hours and have been looking at posts very motivated.

From what i was able to rescue, im planning on buying the books Eat for Health and How not to die.

The issue is my habit and mentality when cooking, my mind is very structured and i always have hard time cooking unless i know all the details (for example if i dont know if i have to boil the water for 5 minutes or 8 minutes, i kind of collapse).

Thats why i found a way of life that works for me, as im trying my best to be independent. This is making a ‚Äúlife manual‚Äù. So here i will be filling things like amount of items to buy each week, where to buy them, which meals i know how to cook, etc.

So the reasons of me coming here today are two: 
1) i want to get better and have a healthier lifestyle, as i have ulcerative colitis, migraines and bipolars type I.

2) I want to ask the community for some guidance. The only way for me to learn, is by being a geek as i always am :) that means trying to optimize everything. My dream would be to have a resource that teaches me specifically how to cook in one day for the whole week, teaching the method of how to do the processes in parallel, and the very details including the minimal ones on the meal cooking itself.

I believe that a resource like this will motivate me a lot, because the ups and downs of everyday life sometimes make it hard to keep a daily routine of cooking. I know this about myself, and have been in that place where i barely take care of myself and end up skipping meals, which triggers a whole lot of other negative symptoms

Recipe:

1 can of mushroom chunks (substitutes for meatiness in non-WFPB chili)
1 can Corn
1 package of Chili seasoning ‚Äì your preference, but I chose Williams Chili seasoning

1.  Rinse beans, mushrooms, and corn under running water in a strainer
2.  Add salsa and chili seasoning (half package of Williams, in my case).
3.  Portion out and microwave a portion for 3 minutes.
4.  Store the rest in the refrigerator.

Taiwanese Cabbage Stew is probably one of the most underrated Taiwanese food due to Its look, so simple, plain, and has no fancy ingredients in it. However, I would say this Taiwanese Cabbage Stew indeed is just a very humble dish that is hiding in the streets, if you have ever tried it, I think you would totally agree with me. 

The Chinese cabbage in this dish is So so so Tender and naturally sweet, paired with Shiitake mushroom, the strong, earthy, and umami flavor. The Tofu Skin and Wood Ear mushroom give this cabbage stew some chewy and crunchy texture. However, Carrot plays a big role in giving this dish some contrast color. Taiwanese Cabbage Stew goes so well with steamed rice even noodles. Every time I go back to my hometown to visit my family, I'd never forgotten to spare some time to go to a restaurant, specifically order this dish and enjoy. 

Since I moved to Australia, I started my experiments on making Authentic Taiwanese food recipes, and this Vegan Taiwanese Cabbage Stew recipe is the best by far! Here I'm going to share with you!",Taiwanese Cabbage Stew,1
443,p1hcvu,PlantBasedDiet,"I am the oddball in the family who chose to explore different diets. I never felt particular great from eating the ‚Äúamazing‚Äù food my heavily white pasta, animal balls, and dairy family ate.
It always seemed...weird. We all got together but ate what people kept claiming is amazing ... and then we were so damaged from it we all literally needed to run home to sleep it off.
But what hurt worse is that... I quickly realized I was ostracized by so many by wanting to I show up but just not out myself into a food coma.

At first I had to make excuses. Then I just gave up and began eating and telling others I changed for health, because they would never just leave it alone. I was called rude. I was told sleeping is a sign of it being so good the body needed to process it. I was yelled at . People literally caried I wouldn‚Äôt eat bacon ...and when I began vomiting from them sneaking it into my food I was being dramatic. 

Anyway. I switched diets. And I just began getting my life back. Food actually energized me. I felt good after eating. I could use the bathroom without a 30 min push session . I didn‚Äôt need to pop pills to get me through the day. 

A lot has happened in my life. But I was hanging with a decently good family member. I was willing to eat their non meat food . Just white pasta with police oil and fried eggplant . 

I just can‚Äôt believe how badly it made me feel. I walked into the house feeling good. I left with a wave of fatigue , headache coming on. I had to bail hanging out with a friend because I needed to vomit.

The other person I ate with immediately went to sleep after. But they claim that has nothing to do with the food. They are in denial.

I recently saw a doctor for the first time in *years* for some other issues, and in the process she brought up ""oh you haven't had a blood panel in 20 years and you're nearing 40 years old? Let's do that!""

The initial tests, Comprehensive Metabolic Panel and Complete Blood Count, came back all within range save for my blood glucose which came in at 108mg/dl, with a 65-99 the desired range. I did some looking into it and attributed it to my morning coffee that day, the initial CMP and CBC weren't fasting blood tests, so naturally I had my normal routine cup of coffee getting ready that day. At the doctor's recommendation to verify that glucose is fine, I followed up with a fasting A1c test and Lipid Panel and was just *blown away* with the results! The doctor sent me a message with my results ""keep up the good work!"" Very satisfying and validating to hear that, to *know* I'm doing the right thing.

I knew eating this way made me feel good, I'd heard the science and peer-reviewed studies from Dr. Greger - I love watching his videos, sometimes I'll put them on to relax and get ready to sleep - but I hadn't actually... put it to the (blood) test, unnntil now!

&gt; 
&gt; Non-HDL Cholesterol 68
&gt; 
&gt; Hemoglobin A1c 4.7
    
I had a separate blood pressure read the day before the A1c and Lipid tests, and that came in at 113/71. That was actually a little *high* for me, as my past 3 reads over the previous 12 months have been 105/63, 109/58, and 104/65. Regardless, it's still a great place to be! I attribute it to having been on vacation for a week and not getting my 10k steps in every single day, spending more time experimenting with my new waffle maker, making tons of banana oat waffles and hash browns. Gotta treat yourself every now and then!

Beans and quinoa and vegetables every single day, cooked at home. Flax and chia and black cumin once a day in a glass of water before meal. 2-4 tbsp unsalted sunflower kernels. Usually for dessert a banana or three, an apple, and often a grapefruit, though sometimes I make nice cream from frozen bananas, sometimes oatmeal banana cookies, cinnamon apples, all sorts of tasty treats!

I wish somebody had told me about this lifestyle sooner. I wish *more people knew about it!* To think of all the preventable diseases and pains and heartache caused by eating the Standard American Diet, to see it all around us all the time, to *know* what salt and sugar and oil and meat and dairy do to our bodies and to have everyone around us *willfully* indulging despite the risks... it's madness.

Fiber is your friend, don't toss it out! Wall off your calories, eat plants whose cell walls have to be broken down to access the goodies inside, don't eat a bunch of processed vegan junk food, imitation meats and smoothies.

¬Ω large (1¬Ω- to 2 lb) head cauliflower, broken into florets  
2 teaspoons vegan butter (soy-free if  
necessary)  
8 ounces cremini mushrooms (or button mushrooms), sliced  
2 teaspoons liquid aminos (or gluten- free tamari; use coconut aminos to be soy-free)  
¬Ω cup raw cashews (if you don‚Äôt have a high-speed blender, soak in warm water for at least 30 minutes and drain; discard the water)

2 tablespoons nutritional yeast  
1 tablespoon arrowroot powder (or cornstarch)  
1 teaspoon dried thyme  
¬Ω teaspoon garlic powder  
¬Ω teaspoon salt

üëâ HOW TO DO

Place the cauliflower in a steamer basket over a pot of boiling water and cover. Steam the cauliflower until tender, 7 to 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and liquid aminos and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Remove from the heat.

Combine the steamed cauliflower, cashews, milk, nutritional yeast, arrowroot powder, thyme, garlic powder, and salt in a blender and blend until smooth.

While I believe diet is an important part of my personal health and well-being (why else would I be here?), I want to use it in conjunction with - *not* as a replacement for - the minimal medications I‚Äôm currently on. I have anxiety, depression, and panic disorder, and I am aware of the side effects of my antidepressant. It‚Äôs been life-saving and life changing for me, and even if I would be considered an exception, consuming more media that suggests I could have remedied this with natural methods doesn‚Äôt sit well with me. I suffered for so long unnecessarily because of the stigma against medication, and I‚Äôd like to avoid more of that messaging, as I do not see the benefits of coming off my antidepressant ever outweighing the significant pain and suffering I know is on the other side without it. It helps me stay stable and off more addictive and dangerous medication, and makes it possible for me to live a normal life.

I‚Äôve noticed this trend among natural and green spaces in general - for example, it is difficult to find zero-waste toothpaste that incorporates fluoride. Yes, I am aware of corporate interests, funding, and lobbying - I don‚Äôt need or want reminders to ‚Äúfollow the money‚Äù and check my sources, though I do appreciate knowing where study funding came from and digging into study design on my own.

[https://joinzoe.com/post/expert-webinar-calories-do-they-really-count](https://joinzoe.com/post/expert-webinar-calories-do-they-really-count)
&gt;
&gt; Figures on food labels tell us nothing about other important factors, such as the structure of the food (the food matrix), how the food was processed, and any interactions between nutrients.
&gt;
&gt; For example, [grinding or chopping almonds affects their food matrix](https://joinzoe.com/post/are-nuts-bad-for-you-why-the-calorie-counts-for-almonds-dont-add-up) and allows us to absorb more calories from them than from the same amount of whole nuts. Similarly, finely ground oatmeal causes less healthy blood sugar spikes than larger oatmeal pieces.
&gt;
&gt; Calories also don‚Äôt tell us anything about the quality of the food we‚Äôre eating. A hundred calories of candy is very different in nutritional terms from a hundred calories of nuts or kale.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; ‚ÄúIn my opinion, the back of pack labelling or the nutrient composition and the calories, only tells us one piece of a thousand-piece puzzle,‚Äù Sarah says.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Food is complicated but humans are complicated too, and many factors affect our response to food, from our genetics and body shape to our microbiome and sleep patterns.
&gt;
&gt; Our PREDICT studies show that [even identical twins can have very different responses to the same foods](https://joinzoe.com/post/nature-medicine-predict-1). And identical twins can [gain different amounts of weight](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejm199005243222101) in response to overeating by the same amount.

&gt; If you transplant the gut microbiota from an obese mouse üêÅ into a thin mouse üêÅ, and keep the diet exactly the same (same food &amp; calories), the thin mouse will become obese. WHAT?!? üò≥

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5082693/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5082693/)
&gt;
&gt; A link between obesity and the gut microbiota was initially suggested based on studies in germ-free mice. These mice are raised in a sterile environment and have no microorganisms in their gut. Conventionally reared mice have a 40% higher body fat content and 47% higher gonadal fat content than germ-free mice even though they consume less food than their germ-free counterparts. Furthermore, when the distal gut microbiota from the normal mice was transplanted into the gnotobiotic mice, there was a 60% increase in body fat within 2 weeks without any increase in food consumption or obvious differences in energy expenditure suggesting that the gut microbiota affects phenotypic characteristics related to obesity of the host. Mechanistic studies revealed that the transplanted microbiota not only increased caloric release from dietary plant polysaccharides, but also modulated host genes that affect energy deposition in adipocytes including fasting-induced adipocyte factor (Fiaf). Fiaf is a circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibitor and its suppression is essential for the microbiota-induced deposition of triglycerides in adipocytes. These findings suggest that the presence of a gut microbial community may affect the amount of energy that is extracted from the diet and thus the adiposity of the host.

&amp;nbsp;

I bet that's gotta settle all kinda arguments (on both sides that is) after all these years.

A calorie is really is JUST a calorie, if and only if we human beings weren't consuming it.

Once we've ingested something, our gut bacteria will determine what's gonna happen next.

Simply put, eat minimally processed foods (i.e. let's just keep it simple and stick with boiling / chopping / cutting / dicing / steaming etc. in order to avoid unnecessary or excessive changes that are applied to the food matrix) while feeding our friendly gut bacteria with plenty of fiber.

1 pound impossible meat (it comes in the square packet)

half an onion minced (better in a food processor so you can squeeze out the water)

1 tablespoon garlic (about 4 to 5 cloves) minced

1 jalape√±o pepper chopped up (this adds the heat so if you can't handle it...leave it out lol)

red chili - half teaspoon

black pepper - 1/4 teaspoon 

pipli (long pepper) - if you don't have this it's ok. if you do, grind a 1 inch piece and just put ONE pinch into the meat mixture

1 teaspoon powder coriander 

1 teaspoon powder cumin 

1/4 teaspoon garam masala

Directions:
wash your hands and MIX everything by hand in a big bowl for at least 1 minute

now get a pan and add 1/4 cup oil (i used canola but vegetable or some other neutral oil is fine)

put it on medium heat 

grab a tiny ball and roll them into small cylinder shapes in your hands

&gt; UPFs are essentially industrial formulations mostly or entirely made from industrial ingredients, with little or no whole foods. They often contain substances not used in home cooking, especially the additives for sensory properties of food ([3](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.600449/full#B3)). Typical UPFs include carbonated beverages, bagged snacks, mass-produced packaged bread and buns, and ice cream.    
&gt;  
&gt; UPF producers prioritize taste, cost, storage, and stability during transport, whereas neglecting nutritional quality ([6](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.600449/full#B6)). UPFs are common in the western dietary pattern and generally rich in total fat, saturated fat, added sugar, and salt, whereas poor in fiber and vitamin density ([7](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.600449/full#B7), [8](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.600449/full#B8)), which is detrimental to mental health ([9](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.600449/full#B9), [10](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.600449/full#B10)).

&gt;In this study, we found UPF consumption was positively associated with depressive symptoms in US adults. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, health behaviors, and chronic disease, participants whose UPF contributed more than 73% of total energy intake had a 35% higher risk of depressive symptoms compared with whose UPF contributed &lt;34% of total energy intake.

526,oi2ws7,PlantBasedDiet,"Hello plant based community!

I‚Äôm Dan, developer of [The Scientific Meal Planner](https://scientificmealplanner.com/), and I‚Äôve just launched a major update!

If you haven‚Äôt heard about it yet, this is a tool which utilizes the latest nutrition science to generate extremely healthy meal plans. You‚Äôre probably aware that science points towards a whole food plant based diet being optimal for health and longevity. This tool reflects that reality. 

It generates meal plans that attempt to satisfy [nutritionfacts.org‚Äôs Daily Dozen foods](https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2018/03/metric.png) you should incorporate into your diet daily. Every day in the meal plan satisfies a minimum of 75% of the Daily Dozen servings, something that is really difficult to plan out yourself manually.   
It also has a lot of options you can layer on top. For example, you can generate a meal plan where:

* Every day satisfies at least 75% of the Daily Dozen
* Every day has 1700-2000 calories
* All recipes take 30 minutes or less
* It doesn‚Äôt contain foods you don‚Äôt like or are allergic to 

The big addition in this update is [The Daily Dozen Recipe Browser](https://scientificmealplanner.com/recipes/browse). This lets you browse all recipes in the site, filtering by which daily dozen groups they contain, and other filters that let you find something that matches your tastes. The idea being you can use this whenever you‚Äôre just looking for a one-off recipe, and not an entire meal plan. It‚Äôs freely accessible, no log in or payment required, but premium users get additional filters.  
The other big change is that I made the tough call to remove the totally free version of the meal planner. If you‚Äôve been following the project, you‚Äôd know that I‚Äôve been struggling with balancing my desire for this to help people eat healthy and the financial realities of spending my time working on this. Originally the site was 100% free, to then adding a premium option, to now the latest evolution which is getting rid of the free version.

I still want it to be as accessible as possible, so I‚Äôve introduced a cheaper, yearly plan that comes out to $4.99/mo. It has a 14 day free trial now too. I wrote a blog post about my reasoning for this change [here](https://scientificmealplanner.com/blog/the-road-to-sustainability).   
I think this change will help get the project to a more sustainable place where I can continue development indefinitely. My vision for The Scientific Meal Planner is to continuously improve it as new science becomes available, honing the meal planning algorithm to produce the best evidence based meal plans for health and longevity. [Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm currently working on](https://trello.com/b/UQkPED8a/the-scientific-meal-planner).

I hope you‚Äôll consider supporting the project! Or if you just want to find some healthy recipes, check out the [Daily Dozen Recipe Browser for free](https://scientificmealplanner.com/recipes/browse), forever.

The reason I say ""mostly"" is a lot of times my husband ends up getting stuck with ""nothing to eat"" syndrome and we end up going out and getting a pizza. Okay once in a while but we have been doing it too often.

I love meal planning and cooking and do the meals each week for my husband and I. He loves my dinners but I think it's the in between times, like making a quick lunch or needing a late night ""fourth meal"" where he gets stuck. I am simple and don't care about making a meal out of an avocado on toast or a bowl of oatmeal. He is the type of person who wants something DELICIOUS for every meal and I really only have the time for cooking three or four meals a week.

So, I guess I am asking for suggestions for...

1) really filling plant based meals I can make every single week that are good leftover

2) filling, quick lunches that can be made in five minutes or less

3) any good pantry recipes that are delicious to make for when there is truly ""nothing to eat"" in our fridge","Husband always complaining we have ""nothing to eat"" or the food isn't filling. Suggestions?",1

537,ognxy6,PlantBasedDiet,"I've been vegan for 3.5 years and following a (mostly) WFPB diet for about three. 

I thought the beans smelled funny when I soaked them but nobody else thought they did, so I went ahead and cooked them. I don't heavily season my beans and thought they tasted a bit off, but again, nobody else noticed. That makes sense because they took their portion of the beans and added a bunch of other stuff that would heavily mask the flavor.

I should've trusted the gut feeling I had and stopped eating them after the first bite but I regrettably finished the bowl. About three days later, I opened the jar they were stored in and there was a horrid odor in them, very pungent and a bit moldy even though I didn't see any mold. They had probably been in an early-ish stage of rot when I cooked and ate them.

Anyway, the night of eating them, I let off the damn worst fart I've ever produced in my life. The amount of gas wasn't unusual or excessive. I didn't have any other issues, like cramping or diarrhea. It was just a god awful fart, heavy *and* lingering. It was the first of many over the next two weeks until I caught on.

That's pretty much what has happened every time I eat legumes. I've eaten pinto beans my whole life and in the past few years greatly increased black bean, chickpea, kidney bean, and lentil consumption. I've eaten all of those without issue for years now, even the day before the spoiled pinto beans. They have never done anything remotely close to this to me. Doesn't matter if they're canned, soaked before cooking, cooked extra long, whatever, they cause this problem now. The only exceptions seem to be peanuts and tofu.

I avoid split green peas and navy beans because they will give me bad gas and I avoid whole wheat for the same reason; the effects of those foods are nothing, and I mean nothing close to this. Nothing else in my diet appears to be an issue. Brassica vegetables, peppers, allium, corn, potatoes, oats, quinoa, mushrooms, fruit, nuts, and seeds, pretty much everything else... I can still eat without issue.

I cut legumes out entirely for a few weeks and now have them every once in a while to see if the issue has resolved itself. It hasn't. I love legumes, so even though there are tons of other plants to fill their space nutrition-wise, I will greatly miss the flavor and comfort they (used to) bring me if I can't have them again.

I'm willing to do a stool test if necessary but all of those things seem to be fairly pricey and I'd like to maybe try some other suggestions, if any, before resorting to that.

First, EPA and DHA may compete for residency in membrane phospholipids and thereby differentially displace n-6 PUFAs, which are highly prevalent in the Western diet. This would influence biosynthesis of downstream metabolites of inflammation initiation and resolution. Second, EPA and DHA exert different effects on plasma membrane biophysical structure, creating an additional layer of competition between the fatty acids in controlling signaling.

Well, I‚Äôve finally just arrived in America, and I just spent an obscene amount of money at a vegan cafe: Cesar salad with bacon, a fried chicken parmesan sub with mozzarella, and a free side of Mac and cheese (obligatory: yes all vegan).

560,oesbu0,PlantBasedDiet,"So I know that Folic acid is the synthetic form of Folate. It's not possible to overdose on natural Folate, but it is possible to overdose on synthetic Folic Acid. According to Chronometer I get over 1000 mcg of Folate/Folic Acid which is above the UL, but all of it is the natural Folate form found in food so I don't worry about it.

My question is: If I were to take a vegan supplement that contained synthetic Folic Acid, would I be in danger of overdosing on Folic Acid since I already exceed the UL with my natural Folate intake? Would me taking Folic Acid whilst consuming large amounts of Folate cause any problems or does the body process these two chemicals differently?

The reason I'm asking is because I'm a college student so I need to find cheap and reliable ways to get Iodine (I don't want to use seaweed or iodised salt) and B12 into my diet. I'm considering using the Vegan Society's VEG 1 supplement because it comes in large bottles and is very cheap so a single bottle will last me a long time.

So I asked my mother to buy a Vitamin B-12 supplement for me.

I thought it would be the best one, since 

* it costs around $9 and lasts around 2 years.
* I would take one tablet at the beginning of each week (it's recommended for vegans to take a weekly supplement of 2500 mcg; you can't overdose on vitamin B-12), so it's more ""low-maintenance"" (I'll just need to buy a new one every 2 years).  
* it seems to be free of any animal products

I looked for others that offered 2500 mcg tablets, but they had lower ""weeks it will last"" to ""cost"" ratios. 

My mother, on the other hand, refused to buy it and told me that taking a supplement weekly was ""too dangerous,"" and that I should take one daily instead (I assume because she is unfamiliar with someone taking weekly supplements).

I explained to my mother that, despite what the bottle indicates, I could take one weekly, that I couldn't overdose on it (better safe than sorry if I already have B-12 deficiency), and that a weekly approach wouldn't be any more harmful than a daily one. It was simply a matter of personal preference. 

I preferred a weekly approach because it was more low-maintenance (meaning I take a pill each Monday and forget about it for the rest of the week), but my older sister (who misunderstood what the fuck I said) said that my health was not ""low-maintenance."" with the air that I wasn't taking my health seriously. 

My mother also doubted my claim that a daily 250 mcg supplement would be necessary (I said 250 mcg due to the 1.5 +1% rule) because she found recommended daily dose is 2.4 mcg (despite the fact that no 2.4 mcg supplements fucking exist).

595,o6nt4g,PlantBasedDiet,"Hello all,

I have been vegan for almost a year now, and I have loved every minute of it. My life has improved in a myriad of ways, and I was able to lose ~100 lbs from my previously obese state. A WFPB diet played a significant role in helping me to cut the weight and alleviate other health issues, and I was largely committed to the cause for quite a good while.

However, over the past month or so, I have unfortunately diverged from my dedication to WFPB and have fallen into the trap of divulging on more processed vegan foods. I started a new job that demanded much more on-site time, and I began to opt for convenience over quality cooked meals. This has led me to rapidly lose some of the health gains I had previously made after months of dedicated WFPB eating.

I have done all the research and I know how bad these foods are health-wise, but I am currently struggling with trying to will myself back onto a fully WFPB diet.

According to the audible page, Dr. Carroll claims in this book that you can:

* 'Eat red meat several times a week: Thew health effects are negligible for most people, and actually positive if you're 65 or older' (uh, sure)
* 'Have a drink or two a day: As long as it's in moderation, it will protect you against cardiovascular disease without much risk.' (what)
* 'Eat more salt: If your blood pressure is normal, you should be more worried about getting too little sodium than having too much.' (*what*)

I cannot rightly understand how you can come away with those conclusions. Am I just late to the party and everyone here is already aware of Dr. Carroll and how bad his advice appears to be?

603,o4gohp,PlantBasedDiet,"I... lost my father to cancer of the pancreas. It came in a wave of symptoms , and the diagnosis was given as a death sentence. I had been having a terrible health experience when I was really young. My disability was nonstop given as the reason, so I never questioned it. I got so sick of it at 13 I gave up listening to them and began learning on my own. And there it was: every symptom had an association of some kind to my diet. And, given that a grandparent of my fathers also died of cancer, that terrified me. 

I stripped all the animal foods right away. I was ‚Äúover reacting‚Äù, ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù, ‚Äúhurting X persons feelings‚Äù by rejecting their food. It was all thrown at me. 

I had rashes that filled my body and sometimes ended up on my face. The doctors strongest treatment did nothing. ‚ÄúMaybe we need to give you meds. It‚Äôs risky tho, it reduces your immune system. So really consider if you can‚Äôt live with this.‚Äù (Me: maybe this is diet related doc? Doc: LOL no. It has nothing to do with diet, it‚Äôs genetic). So destroying my immune system is not extreme, but changing my diet is? Ookay.

Rashes were the first thing that went away. Literally vanished in a few months. People around me excused that away. ‚ÄúNo. It wasn‚Äôt the diet. You stopped scratching like we all told you. ‚Äú or... ya know... inflammation went down, it no longer was itchy, and the inflammation being down cured it.

Then, my pain reduced. I began walking more as a result of that pain reduction. Again, hand waved it away while still saying I was being rude and moronic for not eating animals. ‚ÄúYou are moving more and that reduced your pain. If you just listened when I told you to do morning walks you could be eating the same thing. This is the placebo effect.‚Äù

My adhd symptoms really improved when my research into plant based eating lead me to the Methyl B12 and Folate forms being shown to help symptoms. I have already been eating those forms in greens, so I couldn‚Äôt figure out what was going on . Why was I getting a benefit? Once I began supplanting and maxing our that benefit, I had way more energy. Everyone noticed. I was even running. I threw my walking aid away (cane I use to use). 

Would this transformation be hand waved away? God dam right it did. And the hostility towards me just changing my diet also spiked. now I was attacking them apparently. ‚ÄúTell me right now why you are accusing me of eating an unhealthy diet.‚Äù ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say anything, I‚Äôm not doing this, drop it‚Äù. ‚ÄúNo. I work hard to inspect where my food comes from and by rejecting basic science with removing protein you are going to get sick. I‚Äôm trying to help you but there is only so much I can do before you fall off the deep end. And by eating that nonsense (oatmeal and blueberries while everyone else ate pasta with meat sauce) it‚Äôs looking like you‚Äôll get diabetes soon.

This caused massive fights after 3 years of being becoming active, losing 20 lbs without trying (they refused to believe I wasn‚Äôt calorie counting and non stop asked me for my deficit to make sure I was being ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù about this.)

Now, this was all abusive extended family I use to interact with. My father was the opposite. Loving parent. Loving guy. ‚ÄúHey, if you are learning more about eating healthy I‚Äôm on board with your choice‚Äù. He even defended me and halted insults and freak outs directed at me. Numerous times he would see a relative beginning to yell when I would only eat the meal parts that were not animal based. ‚ÄúDoes he tell YOU what to eat Steve? Maybe I should start pointing out that cookies you eat are unhealthy. Lotta sugar there buddy your gonna get fat.  Don‚Äôt get mad I‚Äôm being helpful! Stop attacking my son for his choices or I‚Äôll do it to you‚Äù.

Unfortunately... he never accepted the science. He was in a chronic state of pain on pain meds that didn‚Äôt work.the healthier I got, the weaker and sicker he got. I kindly and non - judgement way tried to show him the control trials... but it was clear his food addiction won .

He hit 50, like his father who ate the same, and died sooner than he should have. He began losing weight too fast... and they found tumors on his pancreas. He chose to change his diet ... but his body no longer could handle the fiber .

I couldn‚Äôt hold it together watching him cry trying to eat without pain. ‚ÄúI screwed up. And now it hurts so much I can‚Äôt even try berries and other healthy foods. I‚Äôm sorry (me), my choices may have cost you your only parent.‚Äù

I was with him when he passed . Sadness. Anxiety. Fear. He couldn‚Äôt even eat the foods he loved anymore.

Dad. I miss you so much. You did nothing wrong , you were never taught this information. I should have tried harder to make it easy to understand .

&gt;What I would like to do is to go back in time, and I want to sit down with my dad, and I want to say, ""Dad, I found out something really important. We can change our diet, we don't really need that cheese and that bacon. There's plenty of healthy things that we can eat. Let's bring in the colorful vegetables and fruits, let's make them part of our everyday fair. Let's lace up our sneakers, let's exercise together."" It's too late for him. But it's not too late for you.

This resonated with me a lot because I feel like I am at the point where it's still not too late for my own dad, even though he struggles with asthma, arthritis &amp; possibly is diabetic. Yet, I feel powerless in trying to nudge him towards a WFPB Diet, even by an inch. I tried my best, but he found healthy alternatives to the food he was eating which I served him to be entirely dubious and basically inedible. It doesn't seem likely he will change his eating habits, at least not anytime soon.  


I feel like in the future... when my dad is dead early and/or spends his last moments on Earth being in a state you could barely call ""living,"" I will think back to this moment... wishing I had a time machine. Maybe I should have tried more. Maybe I should have had more patience. Maybe I didn't push him hard enough. Maybe I should have been smarter in my approach. I was successful in changing my mother and brother, but I feel like I will lose my father in the future. Dying of a cause easily preventable. And spending his last years on this planet not in good health. I hope that doesn't end up true. And I wish everyone luck with convincing your own loved ones if you are in a similar situation.

Today my dad mentioned that he heard lima beans contained cyanide. I dismissed it at first as probably only negligible trace amounts.

It's been tough for me to find info on this, but from what I've read so far it's no longer clear to me that it's negligible. Most sites recommend cooking lima beans before eating, at least in part to neutralize the cyanide-producing compound.

So I have 3 questions:

1. Do raw lima beans contain enough cyanide that a 1/2 cup a day is something worth trying to avoid?
2. Are frozen lima beans raw, blanched, or cooked long enough to address the cyanide concern? Should I microwave them for a few minutes before putting them in the smoothie?
3. What's the best or your go-to bean for smoothies? Looking for ones that are easy and don't take over the taste of the smoothie.

I primarily eat lean meat and veggies for lunch, for breakfast I eat some sort of greek yogurt and dinner is a bit murky, sometimes it's junk, other times it's something like tuna and salad (1 a week to prevent mercury poisoning).

I am 177cm and weigh 91kg. 

My blood results are as follows:
Total Cholesterol - 6.46 mmol/L (3.9 - 5.2)
LDL - 4.28 mmol/L ( it should be less than 3.30 optimally)
HDL - 1.53 mmol/L (it should be more than 1.55 optimally)

I don't know if my levels can be controlled with diet and exercise, I can try, but even when I did cardio a few years ago and was leaner my cholesterol was still not really good. My diet was still not perfect tho. Only once my results showed good measurements.

With all this in mind, I don't know if I should take statins if doc recommends them. They have benefits and sides, but those benefits need to outweigh the sides but also those benefits need to be there in the first place. Meaning if you don't need to lower cholesterol due to ridiculous small reference values why would you? I am not well versed in science, I am just thinking out loud.

I know that for example my psychiatrist gave me SSRI and 'benefits' weren't worth the sides. There were actually no benefits, I was still depressed but I also got sides that remained despite me quitting meds. I don't want that this time.

They're all heavy meat eaters (the kind of people that also cook with lard, have eggs for breakfast almost daily, etc.), drink moderately (used to be heavy drinkers), smoke occasionally but have smoked for prolonged periods of time, rarely exercise -- you name it. It's by far one of the unhealthiest group of people that I know (we're all in our mid-30s). They're all clinically obese (250lbs at least). One of them even just had a bariatric surgery. ""We might be fat, but we're healthy fat"" is something that they would totally say. You get the idea.

However, to my surprise, they (4) mentioned that, according to their latest test results, they're all either very healthy or perfectly healthy (one of them mentioned that his uric acid level is just 1 point above normal).

Now, obviously they could all be lying, but I doubt it. Assuming that they're not, my question is: how is this even possible? Are some people better suited to process meat without in a less harmful way? Or do general health checkups don't paint the full picture (they measured at least cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, and uric acid)? Is health lost 'gradually, then suddenly'? Or is it that they're still relatively young and can get away with it? Are we as a community just overly-conscious about our health? Or is there something that I'm missing?

Not only have my taste buds changed that fruit tastes like candy, but: my pain has reduced; my cardio system is so good that no matter how much normal day to day movement I perform I feel not out of breath; I am walking EVERY MORNING and i feel even BETTER every day I do it; I recover from exercise so well that I dont get DOMS, nor does exercising the day before ever prevent me form doing it again the next day.  


I am also really low income, and my food budget has dropped to about 30-40 dollars every shopping trip (I go shopping maybe 2 times a month).   


However...the second my family and certain friends find out...it always follows a repeat pattern (unless they are in the minority of heavy good person, and accepting me for who I am);  


1. They find out I am eating plant based and dont consume animal products. They ask me why. I tell them ""I am not a vegan. I just love the taste. I feel more energized and less depressed. I am NOT judging you for eating the diet.
2. They begin asking me what evidence I am relying on to determine if the plant diet is healthier out of concern for my health. I supply either [nutritionfacts.org](https://nutritionfacts.org) videos or the studies themselves. Those get determined to be ""vegan bias"", despite the fact that science nor that website promotes veganism, and just promotes a plant based diet. But I dont push back at all, and I say ""ill look into your resources you provided, thanks, its also fine if we disagree, its okay!""
3. Certain people begin to link me more and more ""evidence"" that my diet is not healthier despite me never instigating a ""research war"". Either I dont respond and they get upset, or I respond.
4. Because I eventually respond to their research, they grow increasingly hostile to me by either not responding to me as often as they use to , or they outright tell me ""I dislike how often you are judging me for my diet, its not okay"". Despite the fact that I am never instigating it. 

It feels like me just not consuming animal products by choice results in me 100% of the time being considered an outcast , and I have people beginning to judge me no matter what I do.  


What do you do when you experience this clear persistent bias? Ive considered just straight up lying to people from now on. Instead of telling them I feel way better, I might just say ""I have a condition I dont want to discuss that requires me to consume no animal products, can we not bring this up?""  


This topic always results in some level of negativity if the person opposite to me consumes animal products. My mere PRESENCE of a plant based eater at a dinner table among friends will 100% of the time begin this pattern.

That was the main driver of me switching my diet. pancreatic cancer killed my father, and to be honest...he was in so much fucking pain....he died in sheer agony and it fucking broke my heart to see someone I love die like that. and i couldnt do a fucking thing no matter how often I tried to help him. And he REGRETTED EATING ANIMAL PRODUCTS at the end, and desperately tried to cling to life by switching to a plant based diet. but it was too late...because his body no longer could digest food properly because the cancer spread to his stomach....and he just sat there crying in the end: ""I can't even eat food anymore without 3 acid pills...and it still doesnt work and im in pain every time. I cant even eat, fiber is even worse. I hate this, i WISH i didnt eat those foods. I am being killed by the food i loved, and even in the end I cant eat it anymore, why me?""  


It was the most painful thing ive ever experienced in my entire life. I saw him slowly getting weaker and weaker.  More and more bones were crafting his image as the fat and muscle dissolved. His face looked like a skeleton, his arms looked like twigs, and his spirit died. And a week before he died, he was so deficient in calories from the lack of eating that his mind went away....and I just cried realizing I just lost my father forever...and I lost my chance to say goodbye to the man I loved and called my best friend.  


You handed him coffee. He would keep repeating ""can I have my coffee OP. Please?"" and no matter how many times you told him he had it, he would keep asking. And then you would call the ambulance to take him to the hospital and he puts up a massive fight because he doesnt realize hes sick ""im fine , im fine, stop, we cant afford this insurance costs. we dont have insurance to cover some of this, OP no you dont understand this is too much money. it will take me a decade to pay this back. please dont bankrupt me."" And you just dont have the heart to tell him: ""dad....it doesnt look like you are going to make it another week....the cost doesnt matter anymore....im sorry"".   


I see all this research showing the positive effects of plants and the negative effects of animal products. And I want to do everything in my power to prevent my future kids from ever having to suffer what I suffered through. to see someone they cared about dying in agony...to wake up one morning to see their parent staring at the cealing, breathing in small strained breaths, not able to respond to anything I say...realizing that this was it...saying goodbye. and having to sit with him for 2 HOURS while that strained breathing indicated he was going...but with no real timer to tell me when he would be gone....with a DNR order preventing me from trying to save him....I watched him fucking die for TWO FUCKING HOURS and couldnt do a dam fucking thing.

692,nq4c3b,PlantBasedDiet,"Hi everyone! I recently switched from a ketogenic diet to WFPB. It was pretty much an overnight switch, so I didn't have a period to ease in. I've tried being vegan before, but wasn't doing it correctly (still ate lots of refined carbs, etc.).

My first and foremost goal is to be as healthy as possible. I'm done with dietary hacks and obsessing about the scale. I know that if eat in a clean and healthy way, I'll loose weight.

Now I'm trying to tune my macros/diet.

About me: 35 yo, 238lbs. Moderately active (3-5 days/week).

Using the [TDEE Calculator](https://tdeecalculator.net/) suggested in r/loseit, these are the suggested macros (using a 30/20/50 High Carb pattern):

* Maintenance: 2,544 calories/day
* Cutting: 2,044 calories/day
* Protein: 153g
* Fats: 43g
* Carbs: 255g

I'm using Cronometer to log what I eat, but I'm still struggling to meet my protein needs, even after having some protein powder (which I'm not a big fan of, I'd rather stay off it if possible).

I'm also trying to do 16/8 IF but so far I'm reconsidering if the ketogenic effects of IF are really worth the overeating I have to do at breakfast and lunch.

A typical day of eating looks like this:

* Breakfast: 
    - Oats &amp; fruit
        - 50g rolled oats
        - 10g pecans
        - 10g walnuts
        - 5g almonds
        - 1/2 tbsp chia seeds
        - 1/2 tbsp hemp seeds
        - 1/2 tbsp flax seed
        - 1/2 tbsp pumpkin seeds
        - 30g blueberries
        - 60-70g strawberries (4)
        - A few goji berries
    - Smoothie
        - 1 cup of sugar-free almond milk
        - 1/2 banana
        - 1 big scoop of peanut butter
        - 2 scoops of Orgain protein powder
* Lunch
    - 80g black beans
    - 80g lentils
    - 80g chickpeas or hummus
    - 80g quinoa
    - 80g brown rice
    - 1 potato
    - Salad or cooked veggies (dark leafy greens, tomato, mushrooms, etc.).
    - Avocado (1/2 of a small one or 1/4 of a large one).

My issue here is that, after eating all of that, I'm still at ~1,500 calories and 70g of protein (and that's considering that Cronometer overcounts the calories in oatmeal by a factor of 3, so realistically I'm having some 200 less calories than what Cronometer says, and adding the smoothie which I didn't have initially). I don't feel hungry by dinner time, but I kind of try to eat something to bump up my protein intake. However, I don't want to force feed myself.

[Here are my Cronometer stats](https://imgur.com/a/gOohbZU)

Any suggestions on how I can improve my meals? Should I eat until I feel full or do I need to grow a bigger stomach to process all those delicious plants? Or might there be something wrong about the way I'm logging in my calories?

However, I recently dove deeper into alcohol by watching all the videos/reading all the studies about how alcohol is actually a carcinogen. A potentially big one, too. So I decided I would cut it out, or at least reduce it dramatically. This whole week was easy up until tonight (Friday) when my boyfriend and some friends and I went out to dinner.

But then afterwards they all wanted to go to another bar where live music was playing, so we went and I kept drinking my soda waters, but I could tell how much looser and bubbly they were than me, and I started to feel left out?

I'm only 95% plant-based so I hope this isn't an issue. If it is, feel free to delete.

Anyway, I just started a few months ago due to health reasons (autoimmune condition - eczema, gut issues, and hormonal imbalance)

I've been eating mostly legumes, rice, oatmeal, whole grain bread, and a lot of fruit. And holy crap, what a difference this diet has made in my life.

First of all, my gut health hasn't been this good in a while. Antibiotic usage from a few years ago completely destroyed my gut health and I was suffering from a lot of food intolerances but now I've been able to successfully incorporate all those foods back into my diet (nightshades, gluten, grains, etc)

Second of all, my skin looks amazing now (during the first few weeks I had horrible skin breakouts after reintroducing some foods, but it went away). Now, I haven't had any major eczema flare-ups and the horrible chin acne I've been having on and off for years has completely gone away without any acne medication.

And third, I'm at the leanest I've ever been in my life.

I've been pretty active for a while now, but I just haven't been able to shed the fat. I had also been dealing with some hormonal issues, which I suspect was one of the reasons for not being able to shed some fat.

FYI, I'm still currently at the same weight, my body composition just changed. I'm so much leaner now and I can finally see muscle definition.

What's crazy is I haven't changed my exercise routine, I actually workout less now, and I even eat a lot of white rice and noodles. Yet the fat is just coming off so easily now!

Taking the plant-based route has been one of the best decisions I've made in my life. And btw, the book Fiber Fueled brought me to this point. So thank you Dr. Will Bulsiewicz! If you haven't read that book yet, go pick it up now! Worth every penny and time.

If anyone's interested in my journey, here's an article I wrote!

I am, on the other hand, eating more tofu, beans, whole grains, fruit, and vegetables than before, so hard to narrow down.

For reference, I‚Äôm 26M, 165 lbs., with no preexisting conditions. I‚Äôd be surprised if I had a deficiency - I‚Äôm eating way healthier than before, hitting the daily dozen most days, get b-12 from my daily plant milk, take a multi-vitamin and vitamin-d daily, the occasional extra b-12. 

If it helps, this is my standard daily meal plan (with mild variations)

Breakfast: Rolled Oats with plant (soy or oat) milk, chia seeds, flax seeds, banana, a dash of peanut butter and a few dark chocolate chips or cacao powder.

Mid-morning snack: An apple.

Lunch: generally a meal prepped with whole grains (brown rice or quinoa), beans (black or chickpeas), and vegetables. My go-to‚Äôs are lentil stew, burrito bowls, pasta with chickpeas and veggies.

Afternoon snacks: carrots or cucumbers and hummus, occasional dark chocolate, maybe some more fruit, and the occasional handful of chips (I know, not WFPB).

Dinner: Big smoothie with lots of greens (usually broccoli, spinach, and/or kale), vegan protein powder or Huel, blueberries, turmeric, avocados, sometimes hemp/chia.

Hope this detail helps!

I've been trying to adopt a WFPB diet for about 4 years now, but after 20+ years of binge eating I find I keep falling into the same loop.  


1. Eat WFPB for 1-3 days.
2. Feel cravings for unhealthy food (sugar, oil, refined flour, fried food)
3. Binge eat for 3-14 days (almost all meals are junk, takeout, etc.)
4. Feel bad enough to try and restart
5. Either restart with a varied WFPB diet or, more often, attempt a strict monodiet (potato fast)  

6. Go to 1.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand all the science behind this - how dopamine signaling plays into binge eating, how taste buds affect signaling and how long it takes for taste buds to reset to lower levels of palatability, how the gut biome affects mental health... but I cannot seem to get over the hump of 21 or 30 days or however long it takes. For those 1-3 days it takes real effort, a fight with each meal, and then I wear out. Or, I feel OK with the meals but I get frustrated that i don't feel better and I give up because it seems pointless.

I like to do a bit of exercise each day and for a few months of the year i will also focus on full body muscle building to maintain a decent core.

Because of this getting enough protein is important to me. Im not talking over 1gram per kg in weight, but a decent 0.7 or 0.8g per kg as I have a big frame from someone whos 5 foot 8.

So naturally I would vary my protien to try and insure i was getting enough amino acid types that i could make complete protiens etc.

This worked great until a month or 2 ago when i started to have great pain all around my digestive system and it would swell up bad and have a lot of trapped gas. This could last for a few hours of pain and I woild have to try walk it off. Also some bad wc would happen and i would eat light and ot would be ok then. 

I loved eating a lot of lentils and chic peas and beans for my protien but these seem to be the key culprits. I cut them out for a few weeks and had no issues and i started to slowly added them back in with a small amount of beans yesterday and today and today it flared up again. 

My fear is now I will have to start eating fish like sardins mackeral and salmon again in order to get the protien ans iron etc I need and want as my favourite sources no longer seem to agree with my gut.

I dont mind compromising. Im not trying to be a religious fanatic when it comes to this diet. If a few pepperonis gets her to eat some overall healthy food, whatever... I already cook two seperate meals at times just to make sure she eats something. She's always been a low percentile weight (long before I committed to not eating crap).

**TLDR:** Just the title. Also, tips for eating and buying cheaply would also be appreciated.

**Context**

Currently, here's why I tend to eat on a regular basis.

For **breakfast**, I usually eat 4 slices of bread with peanut butter (outside of what I use on the bread, I eat about 3 scoops). Another option includes oatmeal.

For **lunch**, I either eat the same thing, or cereal with soy milk. On rare times, we would get takeout as well.

For **dinner**, I eat rice. Or the same thing I had for breakfast.

For **snacks**, I eat fruit, crackers and occasionally peanuts or lettuce.

(I also eat multivitamins on a semi-regular basis)

As you can tell, my diet is pretty shitty.

Since I began to become vegan (not for health reasons, but for ethical ones), and out of a desire to be a functional adult, I've started to research how to eat healthy.

I decided to divide my diet into 5 food groups and 4 meals.

*Food Groups*

* Fruit
* Vegetables
* Whole Grains
* Legumes
* Nuts &amp; Seeds

*Meals*

* Breakfast
* Lunch
* Snacks
* Dinner

I've also done research on the slew of nutrients I need for a healthy diet.

**Problem**

My main issues with my diet are the following:

* It lacks in variety in terms of food groups (mostly Grains)
* It's probably deficient in nutrients or calories.
* I tend to eat the same thing a lot of the time.

As a result, I want to be more educated on planning meals for my health and general well-being.

But I'm an absolute beginner when to meal planning.

* I don't plan my meals ahead of time, which I know would cause issues in the long run.
* I've researched the food groups and nutrients involved in a healthy vegan diet, but I don't know how to coherently combine all of these into balanced meals, or an actual plan.
* I've realized that I haven't really ""explored the food world,"" which I believe is one of the reasons why my diet is so monotonous. I typically think ""bread, oatmeal"" for breakfast, and ""sandwich, rice"" for lunch and dinner. I never really had foods like ""soups"", ""casseroles"", ""salads"", ""stews"", ""burritos"" or stuff like that before. I never really tried that many vegetables or beans either. I've never tried tofu or tempeh before as well. There are thousands of other foods/meals out there, and I'm unfamiliar with many of them. This is something I would like to improve on.
* I don't know how to cook. Although, I have recently learned how to make oatmeal.

767,nb5k82,PlantBasedDiet,"Okay, so here's what's going on. Initially, I was just making a quart of mixed nut milk and I'd use the pulp to make a cheese and eat it with some cookies I make and everything was fine. The volume of pulp was manageable and I found a good use for it.

I then started making the almond-sesame seed-rice yogurt /u/iLoveSev had posted about earlier. Problem? I'm making double the amount (I want to ideally eat some yogurt after both lunch and dinner, so even double the recipe amount will only last me two days or so) and I'm using brown/red rice (rather than the white rice used there), which means I'm getting a ridiculous amount of pulp from this. Okay, no problem. I'll just start putting pulp into my pancakes in the morning. This is getting to be a problem, but I think I can make this work.

Then, I realized that I'm using about a cup of my mixed nut milk a day for the pancakes, which means that the milk is disappearing twice as quickly (I usually drink about a cup of it with my chai in the morning). I decided to make sunflower seed milk instead for the pancakes (since I'm not made of money). This, I think, crosses an inflection point.

I'm currently sitting with the pulp from the last time I made the yogurt, *this* time I made the yogurt, and the sunflower seed milk I just made. On top of this, I'm sitting on the cheese from the last quart of nut milk I made (which I finished in two days...). I'm at the point where I'm not even sure how to store all this pulp, let alone use it. I live by myself and don't really bake a lot (at least, not things that would normally use flour), so I can't sub in the pulp. I'll try increasing the amount of pulp I put in my breakfast pancakes, but the volume is getting to be quite large.

771,navzcb,PlantBasedDiet,"So, I've taken the regular banana oat nutmilk pancakes and started playing with them to see how nutritionally dense I can make them.

1. 1 cup rolled oats
2. 1/2 cup leftover pulp from making almond-sesame seed-rice yogurt
3. 3 tbsp chia seeds
4. 3 tbsp sesame seeds
5. 1 medium banana
6. 1 cup nutmilk
7. Mystery ingredient for variety (blueberries, cacao, etc)

I usually run the oats and chia seeds first through the food processor to break them down before adding the rest of the ingredients. This amount usually makes 2 medium-to-large pancakes (they come out much larger because of the extra pulp). The pancakes come out delicious and there's endless variety because of ingredient number 7. The nutmilk amount is increased here because of the chia seeds, since otherwise the batter will be too dry.

Based on just the oats, bananas, and seeds, I get:

1. at least 25 grams of protein
2. at least 26 grams of fiber
3. at least 29 grams of healthy fats
4. about 40% or so of the daily intake for calcium

I have not included the nutrition content for the fiber (not sure exactly what's in it and what makes it into the milk), nutmilk (depends on how you make it or what brand you buy), or the mystery ingredient (because it's, well, a mystery). All told, it's likely over 1000 calories, especially if you make fairly thick nutmilk like I do.

774,nakv2u,PlantBasedDiet,"Hi guys, I would love some input on how you deal with food miles and the carbon emissions of your diets. I haven't eaten farmed animal products in about 7 years, but in that time I was hunting and spearfishing to ensure my protein sources were as low impact and sustainable as possible.

Recently, my wife (who was vegan before we met and began eating my harvested animal products soon after we started dating on her own volition) has decided she would like to return to a strictly plant based diet. By default I have hung up my speargun and bow and gladly matched her diet.

I am a freelancer with lots of spare time and do all of the cooking and shopping for us. I love cooking and eating a plant based diet but recently I have begun to struggle with the packaging and food miles behind every source of protein I can find.

Living the most harmonious with nature and lowest carbon footprint lifestyle is what matters most to me and the amount of packaging and food miles behind beans, tofu, tempeh, protein powders, nuts, legumes, and everything else I can think of to buy for us is so disheartening. It feels like I was living much more harmoniously with the local environment when I was selectively harvesting it myself. 

Going in to shops and buying big bags of beans that were factory farmed and shipped countless miles feels like it must be doing so much harm to many different ecosystems before it ends up on my plate. I end up feeling grossed out and sad by the food I cook.

Am I overreacting? Am I missing a protein source? Can someone link an up to date peer reviewed paper about the impact of the production and transportation of common vegan protein sources? 

For context, I find all meat farming to be deplorable and realize that hunting and gathering is not a sustainable practice for most of the world's population. I will forever support all of those who do not consume animal products and believe the world would be a better and greener place if livestock farming was replaced with other means of protein production. Also, I forage lots of our food  while I'm out at work or climbing (mostly mushrooms and green leafy stuff at this time of year) and we grow as much veg and legumes as we can.

More than anything I do not want to turn this into an argument about ethics and morals. I just want in making personal dietary choices that cause the very least impact on the world around me.

Should i wait till may 25 and continue waiting for a considerably better discount or should i bulk order for around 70 dollars (total of 3,200 grams of hempseeds).

I don't think I'd have a problem waiting for a better discount, but summer is coming, weather is getting hotter, shipping will take around 2 weeks i think.

The reason im asking is I'm ordering acerola cherry freeze dried powder from a store, they also sell maqui berry powder too.

Why powder?

I don't eat berries, they're sour and they're bad for my teeth, i have cavities and i can't go to the dentist in at least over a month, plus i hate berries anyway, blackberries are way too sour, so are raspberries, blueberries being the least so but still very sour and not that good tasting.

Maybe the fresh ones are better but it's hard to find those, mostly they sell frozen bags of these where i live.

Anyway the price for 250 grams of maqui berry freeze dried powder is 27 dollars, adjusted with the shipping price they'd probably cost around 35 dollars? 

It's 27 for maqui, and around 29 for acerola (contains more than daily requirement of vitamin c per 1 dried gram). And as for the shipping it's 14 dollars.


I would be taking around half a gram of freeze dried maqui a day, in the form of a capsule which I'll be filling myself, as to prevent the berry powder from coming into contact with my teeth and lowering the ph of my mouth.

Half a gram is very little but I'm sure since it's very potent it'd be more than enough to make a difference.

As for acerola it'd be half a gram to a gram.

I would probably up the dose of the maqui to a gram but it'd mean swallowing more capsules or bigger capsules, I'm like yeah i won't bother, at the same time I'll save money.

The berry powder ends up cheap, because it's like 35 usd but 250 grams would last at least a year, so 35 usd for at least a year is not much.

J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci. 2005 Jul;60(7):862-5.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16079208

Abstract

BACKGROUND:
Our goal was to assess the prevalence of common causes of death and the demographic variables in a selected population of centenarians.

METHODS:
The autopsy reports and medical histories of all individuals &gt; or =100 years, dying unexpectedly out of hospital, were gathered from 42,398 consecutive autopsies, performed over a period of 18 years at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, Vienna. These records were evaluated with regard to age and sex, circumstances of death, season, time and the cause of death, as well as the presence of any other comorbidity.

RESULTS:
Forty centenarians (11 men, 29 women) were identified with a median age of 102 +/- 2.0 (range: 100-108) years. Sixty percent were described as having been healthy before death. However, an acute organic failure causing death was found in 100%, including cardiovascular diseases in 68%, respiratory illnesses in 25%, gastrointestinal disorders in 5%, and cerebrovascular disease in 2%. Additionally, centenarians suffered from several comorbidities (cardiac antecedents, neurologic disorders, liver diseases, cholecystolithiasis), which were not judged to be the cause of death.

CONCLUSIONS:
Centenarians, though perceived to have been healthy just prior to death, succumbed to diseases in 100% of the cases examined. They did not die merely ""of old age."" The 100% post mortem diagnosis of death as a result of acute organic failure justifies autopsy as a legal requirement for this clinically difficult age group.

I have switched to a mostly WFPB diet approach to eating! I have about 25 pounds of weight to lose (I‚Äôm switching to more endurance style training from a more strength training approach). I‚Äôm on the highest end of my BMI but have a lot of muscle mass. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 F and 158 pounds.

I decided to adopt the Starch Solution approach for the time being as it seems to really work for people. I was just wondering as I‚Äôve tracked calories on a few days - I‚Äôm eating 1200-1400 calories a day - which is very LITTLE calorie wise for me (my TDEE is between 2300-2400). But I feel full and satiated. 

Does anyone know if I continue to eat very low calories for around 3-4 months and under my BMR - if it will severely impact my metabolism once I‚Äôve reached my weight goal? Will this cause problems/will I have to slowly increase calories for a long time after? Or am I overthinking it and underestimating the adaptability of the human body?

822,n2m8pm,PlantBasedDiet,"Hi, new to this community.

I been reading and watchinf videos and I cant seem to find this soecific anawer.

So this is what ai understand (maybe you can correct me too).  When you eat carbs, turns to glycogen, goes into blood stream and insulin comes in. Sugar is stored first into muscles, then Liver, ans rest as fat.

So, if all the carbs, plant based that is, I eat, is used up from moving/exercises/or sleeping(thermogenesis), then insulin  takes sugar from muscles (assuming im eating proteins chickpeas too etc), it would be burned off first, then liver sugars is burned off. 

So, if in eating alot of good carbs, how is my stored fat from many many years, will burn off if insulin keeps burning my sugars and not my fat ? 

I can think of the laws of thermodynamics (thermogenesis) ,if im eating so much of the water density plant based carbs, im getting full so less calories and therefore, the rest would be  my stored fat ? And if so, is that from walking, some exercise and fidgeting and sleeping all mixed together to burn it ?

Maybe because of that their body just relies on dietary dha and epa so it doesn't try to convert ala, we have seen how the body adapts to stuff, so maybe when we stop consuming dha and epa we become better at converting ala to epa and dha?

I wish there were more studies on this, something that could help support that ALA intake can result in same benefits.

870,mu70sh,PlantBasedDiet,"So I've been wanting to get on a plant based diet for a while now, my wife likes it, I feel great when we do make healthier meals but I am having some issues. I have eaten a typical American diet my whole life, and because of this I have a set list of items in my head that I always buy when I grocery shop (yes I am the chef at home) because I know my list of items can make many different meals that are all delicious. We have been exploring plant based meals one recipe at a time but it is becoming very difficult to go to the store every day to get (in my mind) a bunch of random stuff I don't typically eat only to make one meal out of it. What I could really use is a simple list I can buy when I shop that allows me to make many different meals, and would also be available at my rural grocery store. Also I am looking for a resource for good recipes that have a lot of flavor. We can eat more plainly that we are accustomed to with our high fat high salt, plenty of meat diet but its hard to transition straight to plain food and many recipes I find are bland. I guess I just want everything, good taste, healthy food, and a simplified convenient shopping list that makes many good meals. I understand if I cant have it all but if somebody could point me toward a good cook book I can figure the rest out. I have been looking at recipe books online and the reviews on most of them are so mixed idk what to believe.",Newbie Needs a Cook book/ shopping guide that is convenient,1
871,mu4ak6,PlantBasedDiet,"When I first went WFPB I did a lot of curries, but I went off that when I realized the Trader Joes curry sauce I was using was chock full of coconut. (Tastes great, but yeah probably 80% of *non*\-WFPB diet RDA of saturated fat in a single meal :-)

Over this weekend, I made a vegetable/Tofu curry using one of the Patak's simmer sauces that seemed fairly low in fat (just like 3% saturated fat, though probably closer to 10% since I used about three servings). They do list coconut and also canola oil as ingredients. All I did was cut up carrots and a potato, put them in a fry pan with just enough water to come close to covering them, waited until the water partly boiled off then added the Tofu and simmer sauce and some diced green chiles (from a can) and simmered some more.  

I really enjoyed it, and it is an easy three+ servings of beans plus lots of veggies. *But*, I would like to make my own WFPB simmer sauce. I know there are recipes online, but they always seem to have a lot of ingredients and seem complex (I'm not much of a chef). Is there a basic 3-4 ingredient curry simmer sauce I could mix up and have available? Just looking at ""curry"" on Wikipedia seems like the main ingredients are turmeric, cumin, coriander, ginger, and fresh or dried chilies (and probably water to make it a liquid) but I have no idea of the ratios, or if one or two of those could be left out while still tasting good (I'm looking for simplicity here). The chiles could be left out of the sauce and added when simmering as I did before. I know there are pre-mixed curry powders out there but the compositions seem all over the place, and I'd like to not be tied to a single pre-mixed curry brand. 

Any recipes, or links to recipes, for a truly simple WFPB curry simmer sauce that could be mixed up and stuck in the fridge for a week or two? Thanks in advance for any ideas.",Simple WFPB curry simmer sauce?,1

873,mtthth,PlantBasedDiet,"Every couple of months I like challenging my own ideas and beliefs, so I search for evidence *against* a whole food plant based diet (amongst other topics). I try to find science-based info, peer-reviewed articles, university based research results, and so on, but I also read from more mainstream sources (my business is in this field, so I want to be up to date with what most people read).

The purpouse is to NOT end up reading Dr. Greger's opinion or any of our old-time favourites', as that would defeat the aim of the exercise.

It often ends up being about [anti-nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/anti-nutrients/), and this time in particular it was all about lectins. A couple of articles got me almost worried and questioning things (before I found out they were linked to Dr Steven Gundry), but a better look around and another little while spent reading online article put my heart back to rest.

Interesting how you get a feeling from the type of words used if the author is trying to sensationalize an aspect of our diet and basically scare people away. Usually 'absolute' words are a big red flag (today reading about ""killer lectins"" gave me a giggle - [https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/foods-high-in-lectins](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/foods-high-in-lectins))

In conclusion, lectins are unavoidable and if properly processed not harmful at all, actually beneficial:

&gt;Avoiding lectins altogether would mean avoiding almost all plant foods, which would mean avoiding a majority of the foods that the longest-lived people in the world consumed every day of their lives as well as the foods shown to reduce risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes. Cooking properly, soaking, or buying canned beans protect you from digestive discomfort and potential harm.¬†

886,ms2q7i,PlantBasedDiet,"Hi everyone,

After watching a bunch of documentaries (What the health, among others) and generally feeling lethargic on my animal product rich lifestyle, plus reading about the animal product link to diabetes, heart disease and cancer, I figured it's time for a change. 

I bought the how not to die cookbook, swapped out my diary products with non diary for the transition, but here's the thing. 

Because of financial necessisity I currently live together with my friend who is a nurse and considers herself somewhat of an expert on nutrition. She thinks chicken, fish, eggs and dairy are healthy, etc. She also thinks there's nothing wrong with processed foods. She thinks instant puree is of the same quality as when made from scratch, etc. She is anti salt in home cooked meals but will eat chips and fries in the weekend no problem. She also hates fresh herbs and in general is super picky about food. You get the idea.  

She is also stubborn as a mule when someone disagrees with her. Like, we do great when we agree on stuff, but when we don't it's best to drop the subject alltogether because she won't budge no matter what facts you show her. 

So anyway, I really want to make the change. Problem is we alternate cooking for the both of us, and she has said she is not interested in going plantbased. 

I want to propose cooking our food seperately but since I have been doing the bulk of the shopping and cooking anyway over the past year I know that's not going to go over well. 

Basically I want some pointers on how to approach this conversation. My greatest weakness is that I am very sensitive to the judgments of friends and family and while I have made progress, I still find it hard to tackle stuff like this when it comes to big lifestyle changes.

Let's see.  I make a lot of minimal starchy veggies like potato baked or ""pan fried"", rice in a saucepan on the stovetop along with salads.  I have no problem going fancy with vegan sushi and all that but that's not my daily cooking which is simple.  I make a lot of soups (tomato, butternut, etc) or stews like lentil stew, bean stews, etc.  Banana nicecream, sure.  When I'm entertaining, I sometime make pasta/sauces or crepes and other such comfort foods.  I don't do much baking involving flour products.

I typically cook for 1-4 people, sometimes more on invite about every other month.

(There are no referral codes, I just want to demonstrate what I have).

**Things I use**:

* Vitamix Blender - smooths soups, makes almond milk or cream, grinds my herbs, fruit smoothies if I wanted them, probably nut butters idk.  A really high speed blender is a game changer for certain things that are best smooth smooth.
* Immersion Blender - rougher results than vitamix but useful in mixing in pot while cooking or crushing ice, etc.
* Ceramic Knives - Chef Knife, Utility Knife.  I use black Kyocera Revolutions.  Ceramic knives are an excellent pairing with vegan cooking as long as you don't bend them - the only food that gave me problems of that sort are butternut squashes.  I used to have a lot of knives, I'm doing fine with a 7"" chef's knive and a small utility knife for processing garlic for 90% daily activity.
* Heavy steel cleaver.  Bashing garlic bulbs and cloves.  From my dad during my omni days.
* Steel Boning Knife and bread knife - when you need flexibility.  Bread with a crust is better with steel than ceramic.
* Small and large peeler - Small is ceramic to reduce browning, large is steel for flexibility for peeling things like butternut squash (ceramic is brittle).
* Induction Stovetop/Cooktop - I just like the speed and control they provide, they heat up and cool down fast.  Cheap countertop ones from Aldi and the like are trash but some online cooktops for around $100 are fine.  Unlike meat, I have very little use for high heat cooking oilless unless it's boiling water, so outlet wattage is fine.
* Mandolin - To make uniform and thin slices like cucumbers for salad or [WFPB potato chips](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/ec1or9/5_minute_oilfree_potato_sweet_potato_tortilla_etc/).
* Mueller Onion Chopper - Coming from a family of chefs, I used to chop all my own veggies by hand, but in bigger batches, I find [anything in this style](https://www.amazon.com/Mueller-Austria-Chopper-Vegetable-Container/dp/B08N9Q24M9) save time if you're making quantity or convenience like uniform slices of mushroom for a mushroom soup.
* Silicon Spatulas and Turners - I especially prefer the [single piece ones](https://www.amazon.com/Silicone-Heat-Resistant-Spatulas-Non-stick-Stainless/dp/B01N32WEAC) as there are no crevices for gunk to hide.
* Pots and pans - 3 nonstick small/medium/lg pan.  One stainless sauce pan.  Cast iron griddle for cooking tortillas.  Dutch oven for stews.
* 6qt Instant Pot - generic cooking, mostly soups and beans, fully or partially.
* Glass Storage containers.  Just hygienic and less worries about microplastics than plastic.
* Chest freezer.  Yup.  Time saver and energy saver.
* Silicon ice cube trays.  I got a fridge/freezer combo without ice dispenser as that feature alone double the fridge's power usage whether or not it's actively used.

Recent addition:
* KitchenAid KCO255BM - I replaced my $25 toaster over for this bigger ""Toaster Oven"" recently, but I love it.  Other than a large dutch oven preparation, I rarely turn on my full size oven on anymore, especially as it's getting warmer, this is just faster and less hassle.  Baked potatoes or anything else.  Timed and turns itself off.  Convection.  I never had an airfryer but I'm assuming with convection this does the same thing much more versatile.

**Things I personally didn't find of use** (doesn't mean it's bad, just not for me and my style of foods) and gave away in meantime:

* Food processor.  Idk, just never used it.
* Dehydrator.  Would love to if I had more herbs but I tend to consume all the ones I grow fresh LOL.
* Breadmaker.  Generally don't consume flour products, buying the odd bread is cheaper for me.
* Spiralizer.  I'm fine eating food in the shape they are in or knife chopped.  Not a big fan of alt pastas.
* Mixer / Stand mixer.  Used this in my baking days but generally stopped.
* Too many Knives - Set.  Even in my omni days, with knife sets used maybe 50% at most, 25% with any regularity.  Chef's knife is always a fine place to start and build up from there.
* Vacuum Sealer - I find gallon ziploc bags and glass storage containers just easier for the type of stuff I cook.  Can get out most air without a machine and freeze with stews in ziploc bag.  I'm not going to vacuum seal cooked pasta, potatos or rice, that stuff is cheap, stores well, and tastes better freshly made.
* Most single use Gadgets.  If a chef's knife can do it 80%, I most likely threw it out.  Or in my omni days, someone got me an egg seperator, even then I just used the egg shells to do the same thing without cleanup.  Or a silicon garlic peeler.

I have been on and off plant based for several years. I started on a really restrictive meal plan. I lost a lot of weight and felt good but it wasn‚Äôt sustainable. It required too much restriction and too little variety.  It also did a number on me mentally with the deprivation/over-indulgence/deprivation cycle. 

Since then I have tried to stay plant based but have been more middle of the road in terms of strictness. Meaning, I wouldn‚Äôt freak out if a baked good has an egg in it on occasion or a little bit of cheese here and there. Slowly over time, the ‚Äúlittle bits‚Äù have become more and more to the point where I am full on eating cheese and some processed foods have come back into my diet. The minute I start thinking of ‚Äúrules‚Äù or ‚Äúrestrictions‚Äù it triggers me and I end up eating ‚Äúcheat foods‚Äù

I should also say I live in a house with non plant based eaters. My will power to resist some of their foods has dwindled too. I‚Äôm not eating meat at all, but too many ‚Äúcheat‚Äù items have become a frequent occurrence. 

I really want to get back to feeling good and eating plant based, but I don‚Äôt want to go back to my original super strict diet either.

TL;DR: My girlfriend invalidates my choice of this way of eating, and it's really starting to impact me.

I've been eating this way more or less since 2012. There have been some backslides, and I've struggled to keep weight down. I'm trying to get back into pure WFPB SOS-free eating. 

* Pure WFPB
* SOS Free
* Time restricted feeding (I've been doing 16:8, but I used to do 19:5 and would like to get back to something like that)
* No concern about just not eating some days

I am also in a new-ish relationship (8 months, but during Covid, so moved slowly). She likes to joke about how she's a ""bad influence"" because when I'm with her I'm more likely to eat food from restaurants, or drink (I've had like 3 drinks since 2012 until I met her - I don't have an alcohol problem, but I just don't think the effects/calories are worth it and don't enjoy it.)

I feel sabotaged - I try to cook healthy for myself, and she'll want to go out (well, order in - it's a pandemic). When I eat garbage food, I have a tendency to go of track for several days to a week. 

I've found that I can cook her something much less healthful, like a quesadilla, and she'll mostly be okay, but she'll REALLY want me to try it (dairy is a trigger for me, and I avoid it 100%) and will joke about sneaking it into my food, or giving me some when I'm asleep. It's a true joke, but it enrages me a little bit.

She's also commented that she thinks I don't get enough salt, and she's worried I'll have electrolyte issues. Fortunately, not a peep about my ""protein"" - she is concerned about hers, but doesn't bring it up for me (she has specific medical needs that make her need to monitor protein intake)

I feel like I'm being invalidated. Like my choice is being belittled, and worse, I feel like I'm losing control.

I've tried converting her - that's not happening, so I abandoned it. I've tried telling her about my issues with food in the past, and that helped a little. I've also conceded to rare and appropriate (even though I'd like to be at a healthy weight first) - meaning for certain rare and appropriate occasions, I'll get decadent food with her - so we did for Valentines day, but she seems to think that means ""Friday"" now, and I'm back at square one.

I find it hard to balance though and will go from one extreme to the other, under-eating then overeating since I can't really tell since I don't get hungry really. It's strange because I often get bloated and have a lot of gas so I think that means I need to eat less. I have a history of emotional trauma that could be playing a role in this and I'm also about to talk to a nutritionist, I've spoken to one before that didn't seem to help and have been doing counseling as well.

I eat a plant based diet, but would like to increase my protein intake. I workout twice most days (I get a lot of people think this is sub optimal, but I have the time, I enjoy it, and quite frankly, I've made better gains doing it this way). 

I get about 3,500 - 4,000 calories per day, and the way I currently eat, I get roughly 150g of protein. I'm not sure on the exact amount as I do not track my calories but I know this is the amount of calories I eat due to me being able to eyeball calories from the days I used to. 

I want to move away from processed foods and try a mainly raw diet. I'm just not sure on exactly how I would obtain this amount of protein? I have tried lower protein amounts but I always seem to take longer to recover.

I‚Äôve been plant-based with the exception of Ensure Plus for two months now, and I would like to find a replacement for this one item. 

Why I drink Ensure Plus: Almost a decade ago, my immune system attacked my digestive system. After surgery to remove part of my small intestine, I‚Äôm fine. However, during that time I lost nearly 60 pounds, became 15 pounds underweight, and  lost most of my hunger cues. I also stopping enjoying eating. While I now sit at a low but healthy weight, I still don‚Äôt have many hunger cues and I don‚Äôt particularly enjoy eating. If I didn‚Äôt have to, I rarely would.

This is where Ensure comes into play. Each 8-oz bottle of Ensure Plus has 350 calories (plus a ton of nutrients). I generally drink one bottle per day, but if I forget to eat, I might drink more at the end of the day. 

I‚Äôve tried searching for plant-based alternatives, but everything I‚Äôve under 200 cals per serving, which just isn‚Äôt enough.

978,m1oocc,PlantBasedDiet,"Hi everyone. I've been dabbling in WFPB diet since a few weeks before Christmas. It is a big change so I wasn't beating myself up too much if I wasn't totally strict with it or if I were to ""fall off the wagon"", but now I'm totally hooked!  

I eat 100% WFPB about 4 to 5 days a week while striving for 7 eventually. The other days I would have one small amount of fish or chicken probably 2 to 3 ounces so not a real portion size, or maybe eat something that had eggs or dairy as an ingredient.

Before any one gets preachy about this not being truly WFPB because of what I just shared, let me tell you a little more about my situation. I'm a mom and I have a family who isn't thrilled with this way of eating. I'm cooking 2 different meals at every sitting. With covid and everyone stuck at home, that means 6 meals a day.   I work full-time too. I am lucky that during covid I can work from home, but let me tell you, the struggle is real here with all this darn cooking and meal prep. 

So continuing on with my story, I've been pre-diabetic / non-insulin taking diabetic for 13 years.  In September my A1C, the measure of blood sugar over time, was at an all time high of 6.8.  At 7.0 they usually start you on insulin. 

Here it is, 3 months from when I started the WFPB way of eating and I'm at 5.2 which is considered normal. I've not had a result under 6 in 13 years.  I'm doing a little happy dance now. 

Some of my favorite foods that have made this possible...

Dave's Killer Bagels with almond butter and raspberry all fruit spread

Heirloom tomatoes slices with fresh basil and sea salt

Fruit salad made with lots of berries - strawberries,  blueberries,  raspberries,  and pineapple and mandarin wedges

Whole wheat pasta with Rao's sauce

Oatmeal  with berries and crushed almonds

Pomegranate juice, shooter size portion straight up, or splash in a glass of water.

Vegan Breakfast burritos - basically just  lots of grilled/stir-fried veggies and Mexican seasonings in a tortilla

Yes, I've been eating well on WFPB!  So well I've not lost any weight at all.  I was getting discouraged because of that, but I'll tell you when those recent test results came in, that changed my attitude. I'm more committed now than ever before.

Okay, so I tightened up from a fairly healthy vegan diet to a WFPB no oil diet starting in December. My cholesterol dropped dramatically, my metabolism got even faster and I felt the best I ever have just eating plants.

I've been vegan for 4 years and in the last year trying make my diet completely WFPB. The only aspect I'm still having difficult with is convenience foods and meals.

I have a chronic pain disease. Often during flare-ups or periods of extreme fatigue... cooking is next to impossible.

I can get by with some things like snacks - having some nuts or fruit but the main meals I really struggle with during these times.

I try to meal prep as much as I can but sometimes these flare-ups can last over a week. I've tried freezing food too but I always have difficult reheating it adequately (I am an idiot) or sometimes, to be embarrassingly honest, my brain gets scrambled and I get brain fog and confused and overwhelmed.

Also - I find then when I am feeling particularly unwell I naturally gravitate towards carb heavy beige food. At the moment I'm struggling to distinguish if that's more for convenience or not.

The prevailing theory is a low carb diet because you starve the yeast, but where it falls flat is that you really aren‚Äôt replenishing your gut where a high starch diet would better excel. The most exciting part, and this is really the main benefit is that you will be having lots of bowl movements throughout the day.

This is where a low carb diet fails because you don‚Äôt really pass much, and pushing the yeast out of your system into your stool controls toxin levels.

This is almost opposite of what every protocol says, so I wanted to come here and ask around if anyone has any advice or experience.

Quite frankly it actually makes a lot of sense, you don‚Äôt really have to starve the yeast so much if you are rebuilding your gut first and foremost, and expelling the waste is your main mechanism of action.

It was at that visit I got the wakeup call that I needed to start taking better care of myself - and that started with my diet.  Since then, I have made huge strides.  I've gotten to a point where nearly 80% of my diet is plant-based.  I look better and feel better.

I want to share my success with others, just because it has meant a lot to me personally.  I also would love to get input from the community of where there might be gaps that I could fill to perhaps go completely plant-based.

* Working from home. Around 10 hours a day sitting in front of the computer.
* Some bodyweight exercises (1 hour routine, twice a week), running (10km, once a week), HIIT cardio (whatever nice video I find in youtube).
* Vegan diet. I cook with oil half of the times. I eat hamburgers from time to time (not impossible meat, but those veggie ones), fries, chips, cookies. All of these total around 10% of my diet. The rest is whole food, mostly greens, legumes, fruits, banana smoothies every day. I can get into details but it‚Äôs a general idea.
* Smoothies done with milk alternatives fortified in B12. Around one glass a day. Around one table spoon of nutritional yeast a day (fortified with B12)
* Seeds: flax, pumpkin, hemp, chia. I use them everywhere.

# Conclusions and recommendations  

Your vitamin D levels are very low. Low vitamin D levels can cause various complaints including fatigue, lack of energy and muscle cramps. Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin under influence of sunlight, making it difficult to maintain normal levels during the winter periods. Guidelines from the Dutch Health Board (Gezondheidsraad) recommend to take at least 10 ug of vitamin D supplements on a daily basis for individuals with an increased risk of vitamin D deficiency (e.g. darker skinned individuals, office workers etc.) We recommend you to start suppletion with a daily dose of 300 ‚Äì 880 IE (7.5 ‚Äì 22 mg/day). It can take can up to 4 months before levels have increased sufficiently. You can also start with a start-up regimen of 10.000 IE (250 mg) per day for a maximum of 10 days in case of any symptoms.  

Low folic acid levels Your folic acid levels are mildly decreased. This can cause low hemoglobin levels (anemia). We recommend to use supplements to increase your folic acid levels and prevent developing anemia.  

Eosinophilia:You have a mildly increased eosinophil granulocyte count. This is commonly associated with allergies like asthma, hay fever or food intolerance or seen in parasitic infections.  

# Final thoughts

I feel overall happy. I didn‚Äôt know my Vitamin D was so slow. I was expecting low, but not like that. Regarding folic acid, I can‚Äôt explain that‚Ä¶ I eat greens, green peas, legumes in general. Those are supposed to be reach in folic acid‚Ä¶ I will have to read more about it.

I weighed 252 lbs and I decided to start the WFPBD cold turkey. I've followed it to a T (with no oil) and I weigh 223 lbs as of this morning (nearly 30lbs lost). I exercise 40+ minutes of cardio every single day. In addition, about 20 minutes of weight lifting 3-4 times a week. 

I finally had my appointment with my Doctor to discuss everything, and he ordered a ton of blood work and urine tests just so we can see where I'm at and to make sure that there's nothing sinister causing my hypertension. 

Well... the results came in and my numbers absolutely great across the board. Overall cholesterol is incredibly low (in the 90s). However, my Ketones are at around 1.5ish. This can be labeled as ketosis. After long cardio sessions I have a very strange metallic taste/smell in my mouth that freaked me out the first time I smelled it. I'm sure it's ketones on my breath. 

My doctor didn't really have any comments on it at all. He just stated that it's due to my diet. My A1C and glucose levels are great and indicate that I do not have diabetes. 

Because my doctor didn't seem to care about it (probably doesn't have much experience with the WFPBD), I'm coming here to ask if anyone else is in ketosis because of the WFPBD?

1068,ljoeow,PlantBasedDiet,"Hello plant based community!

I‚Äôm Dan, developer of [The Scientific Meal Planner](https://scientificmealplanner.com/), and I've recently added some new features!

If you haven‚Äôt heard about it yet, this is a tool which utilizes the latest nutrition science to generate extremely healthy meal plans. You‚Äôre probably aware that science points towards a whole food plant based diet being optimal for health and longevity. This tool reflects that reality.

The meal plan generation algorithm is based on information presented on nutritionfacts.org, which I believe to be the most trustworthy source of evidence based nutrition information. What it currently does is analyze a recipe‚Äôs ingredients (down to the gram) and combine recipes in such a way that every day of the meal plan satisfies (or nearly satisfies) [nutritionfact.org‚Äôs daily dozen](https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2018/03/metric.png) foods you should incorporate into your diet daily.  
If you‚Äôve been following the project, you‚Äôd know that[ I launched it about a year ago as a 100% free public service attempting to survive off of donations](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/fj0mi9/i_built_the_scientific_meal_planner_and_its_100/). This route has unfortunately proven unsustainable financially. I thought long and hard about how to restructure this in a way that supports my mission to accelerate healthy diets while sustaining my ability to continue developing the site.

The result was a premium version that costs $7.99/mo and unlocks convenience features which was added [in the fall](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/jya2g1/the_scientific_meal_planner_fall_update/). The WFPB recipe creator community is an essential part of The Scientific Meal Planner, and thus **half** of all premium subscription revenue will go directly to our recipe creator partners. Every recipe in the site comes from our partners.  
Recent updates bring the premium feature set to:  
\- (NEW) Recipe Time Control: limit recipes to be less than 15minutes, 30minutes, 45minutes, or 1 hour  
\- (NEW) Reminders system: schedule a weekly text message reminding you to make a healthy meal plan  
\- (NEW) Food exclusions for allergies or taste: build a custom list of foods you don't want to appear in your meal plans  
\- Calorie control system  
\- Replace replacements  
\- Shopping lists  
\- Nutrient breakdowns  


You can combine all these different options to get a meal plan where, for example, ""more than 75% of the daily dozen categories are satisfied, every day has 1800-2100 calories, where all recipes take 15 minutes or less, and that does not contain anything I'm allergic to"". 

It is my hope that this premium version can foster a healthy WFPB ecosystem so that myself and recipe creators can both keep working to spread the word about the benefits of a whole food plant based diet. There's now 400 recipes in the system.

**There remains a 100% free version** that gives you healthy meal plans. Nothing is held back in terms of the meal planning algorithm. You just don‚Äôt get the convenience features unless you upgrade to premium. This strikes the right balance between my original vision and the financial realities of developing a web app full time.

This is an ongoing project that will be continually developed as new science becomes available. You can expect the introduction of further factors into the algorithm making the meal plans even healthier. It is intended to be a resource for all who care about applying the scientific evidence to live longer, healthier, happier lives. Consider supporting our work!

1075,liflvu,PlantBasedDiet,"Question on iron. At my last physical in April 2020, my blood hemoglobin was slightly low at 13.2 (with normal listed at 13.5-17.5). At the physical, my doctor suggested I start taking an iron supplement. But I am on the WFPB diet, and my understanding is that iron is often on the low end on WFPB, and that it is better to be too low than too high in iron. Additionally, I donate blood at the allowed rate (once every couple months or so). My doctor agreed that the blood donations might lower the Hb. I suggested I would wait to see if I failed the Red Cross test, which requires a minimum of 13.0 g/dL for men. He thought that made sense and we left it there. 

Since then I have always passed the Red Cross blood test for donating, but just barely, and sometimes only on the second try. They will test on blood drops from both hands and you can donate if you pass on either hand. The test is also imprecise in my experience, as one time I failed on one hand and came in at 15 g/dL on the other. So that had a swing of at least 2 g/dL between the left and right hands, separated in time by about one minute. Looking back on my donor card, most readings (the higher one of the two) come in at around 13.4-13.6 g/dL. 

Today I went to donate and came in too low on both hands, in the 11.x g/dL range. I'm told I can try again as early as tomorrow, and plan on scheduling again for next week. If I come in too low again I will probably hold off on donating until talking with my doctor at my June physical.

I should also add I have not noticed any symptoms of anemia.

So my question is, have others had borderline low blood hemoglobin readings on a WFPB diet, either at Red Cross tests or annual physicals? If so, have you started on an iron supplement (and if so how much)? And how fast do they work -- could I take an iron supplement for a couple days before donating and see a positive effect on my blood hemoglobin, or does it take several weeks to kick in?

   First of all, thank you for allowing me to join this Reddit community, I have really enjoyed following the posts.  I'm writing to you today because I am an undergrad who's about to embark on a semester-long research paper, and the topic is my choice, it just have to have some connection to politics and policy. 

I wanted to reach out to you guys for some inspiration on some topics that I could explore.  If you, a passionate vegan could write a 30-page paper on something wrong in the US in relation to the policy that affects agriculture and our food system, what would you want to write about?  In my nutrition course I took this January I learned that while the USDA's ""MyPlate"" dietary recommendations tell us to eat/drink 3 servings of dairy per day, the World Health Organization's recommendations don't specifically push for the consumption of animal milk at all (except for saying you should choose low-fat dairy rather than full-fat, for example).  This got me wondering why we consume so much dairy in the US and why the government wants us to so badly.  Does the USDA have certain financial reasons for advocating for us to drink cow milk to such great extents, even when it's bad for our health?

   I guess at this point I should let you know that I go to Cornell University, where people literally spend their entire college careers focusing on dairy production.  Sidebar, I also sat next to the author of The China Study, Dr. T Collin Campbell, at a vegan community dinner in Ithaca, and actually held his hand when we said a blessing! It was one of the coolest moments ever. 

Thank you for reading this far into the post.  I know enough about veganism to know why I'm vegan, but not enough nuance of the political sphere that has created the standard western diet, and why some people in the dairy industry get so offended by us using the word ""milk"" in our nut/oat/hemp milks.  I don't buy peanut butter thinking it's nut flavored cow butter lol.  That's beside the point.  If you have any interesting perspectives or information that could help me formulate a topic in my research, I would really appreciate it so much.  This community has done a lot to inform me (vegetarian 7+ years, vegan 2 months and loving it) and I would love to put a paper together that could reflect why we need to adopt a vegan diet for our well-being, for animals' well-being, and the survival of our planet too.

1090,lgc8ra,PlantBasedDiet,"Hey everyone!

Unless I get high quality meat like grass-fed beef or elk or bison, pretty much every meat that I eat makes me feel sick and it's hard to digest. Dairy makes me feel sick too and I cut that out a long time ago.

I like the way meat substitutes taste and how they cook evenly and are easy to clean up. They're also not all nasty and bloody.

So I went over to the vegan sub and didn't realize that veganism was like a moral sense and not just a diet. They recommended I come here.

I can't say that I don't care about the animals and that that's not unethical, but it doesn't keep me awake at night. What does keep me awake at night though is the amount of resources we waste to make meat.

Anyways, I think I'm in the right sub now.

Does anyone have any advice for someone newly transitioning into a plant-based diet for health reasons? I don't really like cooking and I'm the type of person that eats to live instead of lives to eat. So easy recipes or methods of cooking are preferred.

Ingredients:

4 large yukon gold potatoes (like really large - about 500g each), cut into big pieces (2-inch thick pieces), no need to peel

3 green chilies finely chopped

1 tsp ground cumin

1 tsp ground coriander

1/2 tsp cayenne/red chili powder

1/2 tsp black pepper

salt to taste

a few Tbsp chopped scallions

We don't feel tired after work, we have been playing more with the kids, we've been doing more work around the house without getting tired. So now I have a very serious, important question for yall:

We have both smoked cigarettes for a long time. Him-roughly 20 years, me-9 years over the last 13. I have a child from a previous marriage and went a few years not smoking. I decided to go all-in and quit when I started this. He still smokes, which doesn't bother me. However, if we have a few beers at night, I'll want one. Has anyone dealt with quitting smoking while full-fledged changing their diet? I don't want nicotine patches or an e-cig..so is there a way to quit smoking at the change of a diet such as this?

I'm not looking for mockery or ""I told you so"" type of comments, both of which we've got from this kind of question. TIA, friends.","Recently changed diet, also want to 100% quit smoking",1

I have been eating a WFPB diet for a little over 2 years now. I have been amazed by the positive changes I have experienced and I would like to help others achieve the same. I believe it would be a meaningful endeavour for myself and something I am excited about.

I want to learn what the transition is like for people. I have my own experience but want to know what it was/is like for others so I can best help where it is needed.

What challenges did you face? What could have made it easier? Where/how did you lapse? What did your social support look like?

A bit about what I am looking to do:

* A paid coach/teammate/cheerleader/friend for 3 months to help start the habit of eating WFPB.
* Only looking for 3 - 4 people at a time, want to be available
* Only looking for people who can afford it upfront, both in time and money ($1275 CAD per month, 3 month minimum - $3825 total)
* What do you think of the price point?
* Can setup free meeting to see if we are compatible before purchase
* Options for people to overpay for the service (pot-committed psychology hook)
* Program consists of phone calls, video chats and texts over the 3 month period starting with an introductory call to learn about client and then meetings over the 3 months to help with switching the pantry over, meal planning, engineering your success, emotional support, and Goals to reach - 3 days WFPB, 3 weeks WFPB, and a 3 month WFPB gradutation, etc.
* The program is designed for a switch to a 100% WFPB diet for the 3 months, not gradual transitions. It's how I did it and I think theres a beautiful positive loop I want to get people stuck in - eat better, feel better, bc feel better want to eat better.
* I am looking for the following values in clients - commitment, open &amp; honest communication, growth mindset.

I have a website launched with more detail - though it is still a work in progress. Not sure if I should link it or not, so if you're intrested in checking it out I can send you the link. Would love feedback.

Personally, I am excited to experience helping people change their diet. I think it will be the first step for myself into a more meaningful endeavour. If I really like this I can picture starting a charity or non-profit dedicated to trying to help everyone and anyone change their diet.

I appreciate your time and opintion!

If anyone would be willing to have a phone call and discuss your point of view further, I would love to do so!

I'm almost 90kg now, still very lean and do CrossFit 5 times per week with some extra bodybuilding sessions in there too. I consume around 120-140g of protein daily but I fail to understand exactly what food I can eat with this diet that will allow me to obtain this amount of protein. 

I'm the first to admit I moved to a vegan diet for health reasons, but multiple servings of mock meat, oreos on tap along with other biscuits and sweets most certainly isn't healthy. I'm ready to cut out all the shit now and really focus on my health.

1176,l0pyz9,PlantBasedDiet,"I went PB \~15 months ago. I have cooked at least six days a week / three meals per day for my family of four.

I started taking my six year old to therapy last year. He was such a good eater his first couple of years. He would eat all of his vegetables and grains and hated when I served a lot of meat. He is actually the reason I looked into going plant based in the first place.

Before I switched to cooking PB, I cooked strictly \[protein\] \[non-starch vegetable\] \[carb\] because I was really into macros and lifting. The protein was always meats, eggs, yogurts. 6yo always gladly ate the vegetable and carbs but didn't like the meat. Anyway, this is how we ate nearly all of our meals for the first couple of years of his life. 

When I switched to PB, things got weird. Easiest PB foods to make are like bowls and soups and stews and casseroles and one-pot etc. Just everything altogether. My son would refuse to eat most of the time. When we had chili, he would skip dinner, he would then eat 3-4 bowls of oatmeal the next morning. I tried so many dished thinking he just didn't like the flavors. He was okay with pasta because that means it's just sauce and a vegetable on the side. So I started buying pre-packaged vegan food more often for him and his sibling. Things like chickpea nuggets, boxed mac-n-cheese, pre-flavored cereals, freezer burritos, frozen pizzas, etc.

So I f'ed up and started buying that junk food for him. His diet choices started getting worse. He no longer ""liked"" vegetables and fruit or oatmeal. He gained \~15 lbs in one year...at 6 years old.

I had several breakdowns about it because I think I was just in denial. Here I was, always promoting a healthy lifestyle, always bragging about my kids loving veggies; but behind the scenes I created an obese child. ^(He is my youngest, and if/when you have kids, you notice that your youngest will always seem younger than they actually are. At least that's how it works for me. After my second was born, my oldest looked like SUCH a big kid, even though the day before my second was born, I saw my first as a little baby still.)

We started play therapy once a week for him last year for many different reasons I won't get into bc it's not relevant. I told the therapist all of the issues we were having, including diet. After several sessions and other relevant information, he was diagnosed with having Sensory Processing Disorder. One of the effects of SPD is having your food touching. I was thinking 'no way is that going to help him start eating'. I ordered some plates with the dividers in them. I made a normal meal, like chili I think (this was \~three months ago), but I put it on the kids' plates in the dividers chili/rice/cornbread. Not a lot either because I didn't want to overwhelm him and have him get stressed that he has to eat \*all\* of that. Like magic, he ate all of it. His whole plate. I had not seen that happen in almost two years.

Since then, he has lost &gt;5 lbs in a few months. I stopped buying the vegan junk food again and now my fridge is full so I feel like I am finally full circle on this post. The PB recipes I use already are getting extremely old for everyone in my house. Here they are:

* pasta with spaghetti sauce or pesto, salad, garlic bread
* any soup/stew, cornbread or homemade bread, rice
* curry, naan, rice

A couple weeks into December I got extreme fatigue. I mean struggling to get through the day and not really feeling like I was getting a good nights sleep. I got my complete blood count done in response. Everything was perfect. 

I spoke to my doctor about what other potential deficiencies it could be. She mentioned vitamin D. In response, I upped my intake of vitamin D from about 600 IUs to 5000 IUs. This noticeably improved my fatigue. However, i still suffer from bouts of it through the work day. Exercising daily helps jolt my system awake. 

It‚Äôs been an unfortunate experience, especially considering I eat to as close a perfect diet as I can. Smoothies in the morning packed with fruits/veggies/seeds. Lots of greens, tofu, rice and beans. Occasional snacking on nuts. I supplement my omega 3s, iodine, b12. 

Is there any possibility that some people need more vitamin D than others?

1188,kzt5gc,PlantBasedDiet,"So, my dad has always been eating like shit. He grew up being that kind of guy who can eat whatever he likes and stays super slim - so he fed himself on a diet of very cheap bread and ham. He was quite proud about only spending like 5‚Ç¨'s a week on food - by literally eating the same shit every single day every single week.
This changed once he met my mum, who loves to cook (and actually understands the importance of eating whole foods, however she is still very much into traditional german cuisine aka meat) he got pretty fat quite quickly. Anyway, 20 years later and unfortunatley my mum is suffering from a disability now that makes it very hard for her to do even basic stuff, so her cooking has been degraded towards making noodles&amp;potatoes without anything. What my dad therefore used to do is to eat her potatoes with ham &amp; cream cheese - lots of cream cheese. Like 250g a day. However, he did his blood work some time in his late 40s and turns out (who would have guessed it) his cholesterol is through the roof.

I have been quite concerned about this, as my mother is already struck my disability and I really don't want my father to die early off an heart attack, so I made sure to praise to him the gospel of the whole food plant based diet. Being sceptical at first, he started replacing his cream cheese with ready-made-hummus etc. However, he lacks any understanding about nutrition and is refusing to do so. I can relate to that, he works in a very interlectually demanding job so in his free time he prefers not to read at all, however he somehow now believes that all the benefits I have told him about are from eating VEGAN and now from eating WFPB. I was okay with that, like eating vegan would still reduce his risk of heart attack, and I did not pay much thought as he was already hard enough to convince that he would not die of protein deficency once he quit his cream cheese. (To say, it also quite helped that I went from being overweigth myself to becoming&amp;looking quite fit after adopting a WFPBD, god praise Dr Gregor)

This christmas was great news. I managed to convince him of trying 2 months on a WFPBD (whole food plant based diet) and to get his blood work done afterwards to look for improvements.

I however underestimated how difficult it would be to convince him of eating the rigth stuff. He now replaced his cream cheese with the store-made-hummus (which is junk food tbh, it is like 50% oil) and his ham with vegan burgers (which are also junk food tbh) and than snacks potatoes with it.

I am just like ehh... like this is not much better than what he used to eat. I however understand that this is very difficult to implement. He has grown up for 50 years, learning that a meal consists of something like poatoes or noodles or bread and MEAT and now I want to tell him that something like a salad with kuskus and tahini dressing is a whole meal? Additionally, he is super busy with his work (which I am quite grateful for, like honestly my mother can not work at all nowadays but he still makes enough money to finance a comfortable life for myself and our entire family while taking very little for himself) and does not know anything about cooking (and quite frankly, does not care - like if my mum is not here he goes back to his diet of cheap bread &amp; ham) and my mother is definitley not able to help as she unfortunatley can not do much more than cook potatoes or so.

I am afraid that while he eats now healthier than before (I mean, ready-made hummus is still better than cream cheese) he definitley wont see huge improvements in his cholesterol etc. and might just switch back to his old diet (aka "" its all in the genes anyway, i can not do shit"")

Therefore  I am asking YOU for advice. What kind of very-easy-to-prepare foods can you recommend me that are WFPB that could be a suitable replacement for cream cheese and ham? Like, "" take it out of the box and put it on the plate "" level foods.

What I'm wondering is, how common is it really to give up oil 100%? Out of the 167k people in this forum, how many do you think have a kitchen with no oil?

I've personally tried ditching oil several times and lasted less than a week each time.  It made me less excited about cooking and I found myself not looking forward to meals. I know it's probably because I'm addicted to oil from the standard American diet ... but I just can't fathom ditching oil permanently. The pasta sauces, salad dressings, and condiments I love all include it.

I've got solid non-stick pans, but squirting water in them just makes me sad. Also I HATE the taste of vegetable broth. And so many WFPB recipes say, ""just use vegatable broth, it's great!"" I also bought an air-fryer to reduce my oil intake, but things only come out good in it if I add 1+ tbsp of oil.

For those who have given oil up completely, do you miss it? Does the addiction really go away after weeks or months? Do you ever eat takeout or go to a (precovid) restaurant? I can't think of one restaurant in my city where I could get a guaranteed no-oil meal.

Kept a note of amounts I did of most things (or at least what size container I filled with something) so I can adjust going forward.

Definitely one of the big perks of working from home for me has been not packing breakfast and lunch, but it's also meant that basically every day I'd be cooking and making my kitchen messy at least a couple times per day. Hoping that now I'll just have bowls/plates and maybe a small pan to clean at the most. 

And, now is good opportunity to organize/declutter my containers cuz basically all the good ones that have matching lids are in use...

So, to give a little context, I'm 5'6"" and 115lbs, and I not only suffer from PCOS (meaning I really should avoid grains/gluten), but I'm also lactose intolerant.

I've been working to eat as clean as I possibly can, and I've really developed a love for veggies. I much prefer eating smaller things more frequently rather than having large meals, but because most of what I eat only consists of raw veggie salads and fruit, it's hard for me to meet my daily 2000 calorie goal without eating *constantly*.

That being said, I've started to add 1 cup of peanuts to my daily diet since they're rich in protein and calorie-dense, making it much easier to meet my 2000 calorie goal. However, I know they also have a lot of fat in them, so I'm wondering if that might not be so good for me in the long run? I've tried doing some googling, but I didn't find anything too negative about them/anything saying that I should eat fewer, so I guess I'd just like some confirmation on that or not. Any additional advice would also be greatly appreciated!

If we're eating WFPB no oil -- is calorie tracking necessary or even helpful?

My thoughts are that, based on everything I've read from experts in the field, palatability increases our drive to eat. When we manipulate food tastiness to be less, research shows that it can dramatically reset our hunger cues.

The cold, plain truth is that the ultimate tastiness trifecta of fat, salt, flour/sugar (I'm regarding flour and sugar as one), all increase the palatability of food which triggers the pleasure centers in our brains leading to overeating and lack of feeling satiated. 

When we remove one of those elements from the trifecta of ultimate palatbilty -- the lowered palatability of food and trigger our brain as much -- allowing our brains to calm down and rationally intake food as needed.

For example, when I eat pizza without dairy cheese (so removing fat from the ultimate trifecta of fat, salt, sugar/flour) -- it's just not as pleasure-inducing. It's mildly tasty with just the sauce and veggies, but it's not hitting my pleasure center the way the standard American diet (SAD) pizza does. 

The palatability isn't as intense. 

So, it's far easier for my brain to say, *Hey you're full and you can stop now* on WFPB pizza than SAD pizza. SAD pizza encourages me to just keep addictively eating.

I'm proposing that if you're eating a standard American diet of mixed hyper-palatable foods, calorie counting might make sense because SAD food is so palatable it highjacks your brain. 

But with WFPB food, because the ultimate trifecta of palatability is disrupted, it's not necessary to count calories, because your brain is allowed to not be triggered, to calm down, and to accurately indicate satiety.

Do you feel this is accurate? What are your thoughts?

A large percentage of the people that don't eat meat, dairy or eggs do it because they're concerned about animal cruelty and climate change (not their own health).  As a result, they end up eating a diet of pop tarts, doritos and mountain dew (which is not healthy).  It's not a surprise to me that a lot of those people have bone density problems.

I searched around on google to find an article on ways to increase bone density that explains what I'm talking about:   [wikihow:  How to Increase Bone Density](https://www.wikihow.com/Increase-Bone-Density)

It basically says:


* Eat a diet that includes sources of calcium (soy, beans, peas, nuts, seeds, leafy greens, etc.)
* Get lots of vitamin D (fortified almond/rice milk, take a supplement or get in the sun)
* Get lots of magnesium (nuts, leafy green vegetables, whole grains, legumes, avocados, etc.)
* Get lots of vitamin B (take an inexpensive supplement once a week)
* Get lots of vitamin C (citrus fruits, red and green peppers, tomatoes, kiwifruit, strawberries, etc.)
* Get lots of vitamin K (green leafy vegetables such as spinach, kale, broccoli, and collard and turnip greens, nuts, fruits such as berries, grapes, and figs)
* Get lots of vitamin E (seeds, nuts, plant oils, spinach, broccoli, kiwifruit, mango, tomato, and spinach)
* Limit amount of caffeine and alcohol
* Do 30 minutes/day of cardio exercises
* Do resistance training (lift weights)
* Do plyometric exercises (jumping)
* Don't smoke


You don't need meat, eggs or dairy for any of those.  I take a vitamin B supplement once a week, get lots of sun and exercise and so I'm pretty sure I don't have to worry about having weak bones.

But even when you control for BMI, vegans are still more likely to have bone fractures.  They have about 15 more bone fractures per 1000 people versus meat eaters, whereas vegetarians only had about 3 more cases.  They suspect this could be attributed to calcium deficiency.

1424,k207yb,PlantBasedDiet,"I posted here about a year and a half ago about my wife‚Äôs successes with our WFPB diet and I wanted to give an update. 

She ended up being progression-free for a year and a half on her last treatment, and the average for that treatment is 7.8 months. We were obviously bummed to see it return, but being on the far right of the bell curve is still something to be happy about. 

Now she is in a clinical trial for an exciting new drug. The side effects are apparently pretty serious, and there are only five participants so far who have been placed on a full dose. My wife is one of them. She just finished her one month mark and went in for blood work, where she was told she is the only one able to tolerate the treatment. The main side effects are nausea and a lowered white blood cell count. Her WBC count did drop some, but not into the danger zone and is improving with every blood test (one per week). She is also prone to nausea but has had hardly any. 

She wasn‚Äôt scheduled to see any doctors, just the PA, but 5 ended up coming into her room quizzing her on everything she is doing, wanting to figure out what is different about her. They are finally interested in what she is eating! The head MD/scientist told her he‚Äôs putting 15 doctors on her case that she can contact at any time, and told us we are going to become like family. They want to know everything she does in life. I‚Äôve read stories about new breakthrough treatments and that first patient that proves that the drug works. We were joking from the beginning of the trial that maybe she could be one of those stories, but now it almost feels like it‚Äôs possible. We just read ‚ÄúWhy We Sleep,‚Äù and have been putting a greater emphasis on good sleep, but we really attribute her health to the WFPB diet. We‚Äôve seen so many positive health changes in her, me, and the few family members who have started to eat this way to believe otherwise. It‚Äôs like we have a secret weapon, but the only reason it is secret is because most doctors don‚Äôt want to hear about it. Maybe this will help put another crack in that wall. 

PS: I was surprised, especially for this subreddit, at some of the negative responses that I got when I posted about this a year and a half ago, of people accusing me of raising others‚Äô hopes when this may not work for them.

1461,jya2g1,PlantBasedDiet,"Hello plant based community!  


I‚Äôm Dan, developer of [The Scientific Meal Planner](https://scientificmealplanner.com/), and I‚Äôve just launched a major update!   


If you haven‚Äôt heard about it yet, this is a tool which utilizes the latest nutrition science to generate extremely healthy meal plans. You‚Äôre probably aware that science points towards a whole food plant based diet being optimal for health and longevity. This tool reflects that reality.  


The meal plan generation algorithm is based on information presented on nutritionfacts.org, which I believe to be the most trustworthy source of evidence based nutrition information. What it currently does is analyze a recipe‚Äôs ingredients (down to the gram) and combine recipes in such a way that every day of the meal plan satisfies (or nearly satisfies) [nutritionfact.org‚Äôs daily dozen](https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2018/03/metric.png) foods you should incorporate into your diet daily.  


The latest update introduces a new recipe replacement system that lets you choose from recommended replacements. This gives you almost total control over how your meal plan is built, so you can be sure to get something that you find appealing. It also adds a favorite system to keep track of your favorite recipes.  
If you‚Äôve been following the project, you‚Äôd know that[ I launched it 8 months ago as a 100% free public service attempting to survive off of donations](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/fj0mi9/i_built_the_scientific_meal_planner_and_its_100/). This route has unfortunately proven unsustainable financially. I thought long and hard about how to restructure this in a way that supports my mission to accelerate healthy diets while sustaining my ability to continue developing the site.   
The result is a premium version that costs $7.99/mo and unlocks convenience features including calorie control system, recipe replacements, shopping lists, and nutrient breakdowns. The WFPB recipe creator community is an essential part of The Scientific Meal Planner, and thus **half** of all premium subscription revenue will go directly to our recipe creator partners. Every recipe in the site comes from our partners.  
It is my hope that this premium version can foster a healthy WFPB ecosystem so that myself and recipe creators can both keep working to spread the word about the benefits of a whole food plant based diet.  
**There remains a 100% free version** that gives you healthy meal plans. Nothing is held back in terms of the meal planning algorithm. You just don‚Äôt get the convenience features unless you upgrade to premium. This strikes the right balance between my original vision and the financial realities of developing a web app full time.

This is an ongoing project that will be continually developed as new science becomes available. You can expect the introduction of further factors into the algorithm making the meal plans even healthier. It is intended to be a resource for all who care about applying the scientific evidence to live longer, healthier, happier lives. Consider supporting our work!

TLDR: I try to get as much protein as possible, still hungry and exhausted. What gives? 

Backstory: I grew up eating lots of meat, but dinner was always veggie, carb, and a meat. Pretty healthy upbringing but after college I started to go vegetarian and I‚Äôve been on-and-off plant based for the past three years. 

When I do find myself committing to plant based, I am constantly exhausted. My energy feels like it spikes and crashes and at about 3 PM, I can hardly stay awake. I know that I should see a doctor about this - and that‚Äôs exactly what I did! She sent me to do bloodwork and I came back hypoglycemic. I am mid-twenties, very healthy, 5‚Äô 7‚Äù/145 pounds, I do hot yoga and spin classes about 4x a week. No other health problems in life, thankfully. 

So I go back to my doctor and basically the only thing she tells me is ‚Äúeat more protein‚Äù. I explain that I‚Äôm trying to cut out animal proteins and she tells me to eat fish. She clearly didn‚Äôt understand so I didn‚Äôt bother fighting her. I said thanks and haven‚Äôt been back since. 

I did try eating meat again for about a week, and I felt great. Less hungry, less peckish, more energy. I stopped again though for environmental/ethical reasons. Back to being tired and hungry. 

A normal day for me looks like:
1. Chia seed pudding with fruit, almond butter, coconut shavings, coffee w/ almond or cashew milk
2. Snack - apple or something of the sort
3. Lunch - big salad of some variety with protein (tofu or edamame) 
4. I have a sweet tooth - something in the middle of the day (homemade granola/energy bars)
5. Dinner - some source of protein (chickpea, tofu, beans), carbs, and lots of veggies normally 
6. A smoothie if I‚Äôm still hungry, or some kind of snack 

I eat between 1600-1800 calories per day. In high school, I was restricting to 1000-1200 so this is a step in the right direction for me.

1503,jtchdm,PlantBasedDiet,"Some backstory:


I started eating a whole foods plant based diet about mid 2018 a few months after I had a ""minor"" health scare. Im a 26 Year old male who is about 5'8 and for most of my life I have been either a little heavy for very heavy (heaviest was 357 pounds before I changed my diet and I stayed around 330-350 for almost 10 years before hand and my blood pressure was generally around 125-138/80-85. I was sedentary and my diet was absolutely atrocious especially in the months leading up to my health scare. After the health scare I was having issues (chest pain) and went to see a ""doctor"" who in reality was a nurse practitioner who I still hate to this day. I go to this guy because I was having chest pains after my scare and I get a blood test before I can even see this guy and when I do see him he tells me im too young to possibly have a heart problem and it's probably just acid reflux and tells me if im worried I should try to lose some weight and lower my cholesterol  or else he would put me on a statin just in case (my total was 200+ at the time and my LDL was 166) he also tells me to change my diet abit to help my ""acid reflux"" which I do but it doesn't help my on and off chest pain in the slightest and I kept going to him asking him to please refer me to someone who can actually test/help me but he refuses and keeps trying to convince me it's just acid reflux and that it might just be some sort of stomach issue so he tests me for H. Pylori. That test comes back positive and Im put on antibiotics( big doses as well) two weeks along with an acid reducer and that had to of been the worst two weeks of my life, my chest pain got worse, I could barely sleep, I could barely eat and I was so stressed from not knowing what was actually wrong with me I couldn't sleep (this piece of shit GP never tested me again for H. Pylori again after to make sure it was gone). This whole time they kept trying to get me to meet with some psych guy due to my stress and anxiety that was caused by my GP in the first place and instead of trying to be helpful or understanding they kept trying to shove anti-depressants down my throat and essentially tell me I was just crazy (Honestly this whole ordeal was enough to make me consider suicide for the first time in 10+ years cause I felt absolutely helpless.)  Shortly they set me up with a nutritionist and they recommended some different diets to me and tried ""keto"" and learned more from ""Dr"" Berg and other Random nobodies on youtube and tried the diet as well as anything they'd recommend and well that didn't work out because I could still hardly eat and ended up in the hospital again due to my potassium being so low it was causing symptoms. 


After that I stopped the keto thing right away found some Vegan youtubers who talked about WFBP and watched and learned and then watched Forks Over Knives and was convinced to try this out and started doing to cold turkey cut out all the animal products, stayed away from the vegan junk food (most of the time id still have some like once every months or something) and the switch was pretty easy since I was considering going vegan before my health scare anyway and it worked fairly well. I was having regular bowel movements again, I had more energy, I was dropping the weight like crazy (I started at 357 and by the end of 2019 I was 230 and im currently around 220) My total cholesterol went from 200+ down to 160 and my ldl was 110 and that was when I was still at around 290-300 I believe so it's probably even lower now. my blood pressure lowered down to around the 115-75 range and even a bit lower when laying down. I was still having some pain and whatnot every now and then but it was much less until around late 2019 I think around early September when I was went for my daily walk and suddenly started having a bit of trouble breathing and semi collapsed, got sent to the hospital where they did an EKG and an xray, some blood work and found nothing. After that I went to see a new GP and this time they sent me to see a cardiologist and not only did I have to wait a month to see the cardiologist while having bad chest pain and all kinds of other problems again I had to wait ANOTHER month for the tests which were an ultra-sound of the heart and a stress test (which had to be stopped early because my pants kept falling, hilarious I know) and when I finally got to see the cardiologist he said exactly ""Well I dunno what's going on but you're 25 so im sure you'll be fine"" and this guy was supposed to be one of the best where I live... and since then I've stuck with the diet, Whole grains, Legumes, Fruits, Veggies, no oil, no added sugar, minimal salt, I try to walk every day (i've tried doing weight training as well but even light training makes me bedridden for a day or two now) I take my B12, I take D3, I try to get enough sleep I try to do everything I can but my body feels like it's shutting down and my chest pains are back. Im now getting blood pressure readings of 105-95 over 65-50 and it sometimes even dips lower to 80/40when laying down(my blood pressure use to be 95/58 laying down when I felt good) hell i even got a reading of 68-39 and I don't know what's going on my blood pressure is all over the place, my heart rate can fluctuate, sometimes im in the 50 to low 60's resting and sometimes it's up to 75+ resting. I can feel my heart beating damn near all the time, I back is chronically sore especially the upper left side, Im getting gastrointestinal issues again im constantly gassy even with low fiber intake, i feel weak all the time, I don't get restful sleep even when i get 7-9 hours, my mouth feels constantly dry I just don't know what to do. I try to do my best to hit the RDA's on everything to the best of my ability on 150$ a month of food stamps plus some and I generally do just fine  but I feel like im getting worse, I don't want to stop I want to keep eating this way I want to be healthy but im so lost and confused I dunno what to do I can't find anyone who can help me medical professional or otherwise because they all just say ""Well you're young you'll be fine"" and not do anything to help but im not im losing my fucking mind feeling like im slowly dying. It hurts to eat now so now im eating even less which can't be good but I just can't force food down my stomach even if its blended up in a smoothie or something.

I think bananas are okay so banana smoothie too. I used to occasionally make a green smoothie, but the other fruits are a no go (I specifically liked bananas &amp; mango). I just am not sure how much banana only smoothies I will be able to eat!

I think it‚Äôs fine to add ground flax or ground chia seeds even though they are fatty foods (harder to over eat). I am hoping the soluble fiber in it will help not irritate my throat.

I need to do this diet for 2 months and my brain certainly will not function well with that lack of caffeine so I appreciate any ideas to add.

1511,jsggjh,PlantBasedDiet,"Hi everyone,

I'm new to this community, and I could really use some advice. 

I'm a 23 year old girl, and I've been about 30-40 pounds overweight for pretty much my whole adult life. I have major problems with overeating that I can't seem to solve, and it's gotten worse since I finished college. 

I'm basically addicted to sugar, and I constantly overindulge on greasy and processed foods. I don't drink soda, but I make up for that by stuffing myself with candy and sweets. Even when I eat healthy food, I always eat way too much. I have no idea what ""satisfied"" or ""comfortably full"" even feels like. If I'm not absolutely stuffed after a meal, I feel like I have to eat more. Then, I eat more and end up stuffed and miserable. 

I really want to overhaul my whole diet and start eating healthier, plant based foods, with maybe some fish and eggs here and there. I would also like to limit myself to around 1,500-1,700 calories a day. Right now, I probably eat around 2,500-3,000 calories a day, but that's just an estimate. I try to count calories throughout the day, but I always end up binging on candy or junk food and basically just saying fuck it. 

I think a big problem for me is my surroundings. I live in the Midwest, in a town where there are very limited plant based options. Most of the restaurants are fast food, burger, or pizza places, with a few breakfast diners. We have a couple healthier restaurants, but they are much more expensive than the fast food places. 

In fact, my father actually happens to own one of the local breakfast diners, so I work there. Most of the food that we serve (and that I enjoy eating) is very heavy, greasy breakfast food that has about a 85% chance of being smothered in gravy. Most things on the menu have meat, cheese, or are deep fried. We have very few vegetarian options and zero vegan entrees. Don't get me wrong, the food is delicious, but I know it is also terrible for me. But since it's my family's place, I get to eat there for free, so it seems financially stupid not to take advantage of the free food. Not to mention, I work five days a week and have to be at work early in the morning and am there until lunch. So I end up eating most of my meals there. 

To top it off, we have some really kind regular customers who are constantly bringing donuts and baked goods for us employees, and if feels rude to refuse. 

I often try to buy produce to cook healthy meals at home, but usually one of two things happens. 1: I have no energy to cook, so all the vegetables I bought end up wilting in a couple days, or 2: I try to cook a healthy, planted based meal, but end up disliking it and being unsatisfied. 

My family is also a big concern for me. My mom's side of the family are a bunch of Midwestern hillbilly types (no offense) who eat something deep fried or covered in gravy for basically every meal. My dad's side of the family is Greek, and while they eat a little healthier, they also eat tons of meat and bread. Eating healthy in my family is almost frowned upon. If you try to eat plant based or eat less meat, or even just to eat healthy at all, you basically get judged and laughed at by both sides of the family.

My boyfriend is the other concern. He's a wonderful guy and I know he would probably support me if I wanted to change my diet, but I'm still nervous about how he'll react. One of the ways I love to show my affection for him is by cooking for him. On my rare days off from work, I always cook us a big breakfast with bacon, cheesy eggs (cooked in the bacon grease), toast, and butter. He always talks about how I'm such a good cook. Back before we met, on days that I didn't have work or class in the morning, I would always make myself a small, Japanese-style breakfast of an egg with a small amount of rice, and some miso soup. I'd love to go back to that, but I'm afraid of his reaction if I stop cooking us our big yummy breakfasts. 

Does anybody have any advice? At this rate, I feel like I am going to have to move to another state and start a new life if I want to get healthy.","I want to change my eating habits, but worried about how others in my life will react.",1
1512,jsfx2m,PlantBasedDiet,"Hey! I've read through the rules for this sub and noticed that it restricts ALL animal products from being considered ""whole foods plant based"". Why is this? And can anyone point me toward a whole foods plant based diet reddit that includes those of us who ARE plant based but not 100%?

When you wiki the definition of whole foods plant based diet it states: 
""A¬†plant-based diet¬†is a¬†diet¬†consisting mostly or entirely of foods derived from plants (including vegetables, grains, nuts, seeds, legumes, and fruits) and with few or no¬†animal-source foods""

Harvard states: Plant-based or plant-forward eating patterns focus on foods primarily from plants. This includes not only fruits and vegetables, but also nuts, seeds, oils, whole grains, legumes, and beans. It doesn‚Äôt mean that you are vegetarian or vegan and never eat meat or dairy. Rather, you are proportionately choosing more of your foods from plant sources.

Healthline: Nonetheless, the basic principles of a whole-foods, plant-based diet are as follows:

Emphasizes whole, minimally processed foods.

Limits or avoids animal products.

Focuses on plants, including vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, seeds and nuts, which should make up the majority of what you eat.

Excludes refined foods, like¬†added sugars, white flour and processed oils.

Pays special attention to food quality, with many proponents of the WFPB diet promoting locally sourced, organic food whenever possible.

Then when we look at the plant based doctors such as dr. Gregor and dr. Davis ect they use plant based when referring to say the adventist health study 2 to group vegans, vegitarians, and pescatarians together and do not mean 100% strict 

Dr. Campbell is 99% vegan
Dr. Mcdougall states he eats a turkey every 3 years
Dr. Dean ornishes reversal diet included low fat dairy AND egg whites and he has utilized fish oil omega 3
Dr. Valter longo says the totality of the research given his 5 pillar approach states that vegan + fish is the optimal diet according to the research (and he was up for a nobel prize)
Dr. Garth davis states according to all the research fish = green light 
Even dr. Gregor states that the plant based diet doesn't need to be 100% 
Dr. Kim Williams in a recent interview stated research shows egg whites have been cleared as good.

Personally I follow all the rules no salt, sugar, oil, I eat 90-95% whole foods plant based BUT include 5-10% of my daily calories from sea-food (no other animal products are bought or consumed). My fat intake is capped at 10% of my daily calories and saturated fat at 1%.

1) Baking parchment. Something to do with juices not hitting the hot surface and evaporating straight away, apparently.

2) Using a mixture of root and juicy vegetables. In the photo he's used golden beetroot and onion wedges. Makes for a nicer (less dry) mouthfeel.   
3) Large chunks/wedges. If you chop it small, there's more surface area and more moisture evaporates.  
4) Leaving skins on where appropriate. Additional seal for that moisture.  
5) Basting. My partner does it once beforehand but could be worth doing multiple times during the roasting? He uses citrus juice. Would probably also work with water/veg or miso or mushroom broth/sherry/wine/soy sauce.  
6) Very high heat for like 30mins, then lowered.

Just over a month ago, I finally said ""enough is enough"" and quit it all for hopefully good, and oh boy has my palette changed in that time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Normally I'd be the first to smash a whole packet of chips and dip at a party, followed by a roll of tasty biscuits then whatever other vegan snacks are running around. Sweet mixed drinks, all that jazz. Well now the same chips are too salty and burn my tongue, the dips are oily, slimy and sickening, the roll of biscuits leaves a nasty oily film on my tongue and throat, and even semi sweetened mixed drinks are just unpalatable. Instead, I'm staking out the dips platter and just snacking on all the veggies used for dipping (minus the dip). Even my preferred soy milk brand has become too sweet as I can taste all the added sugar, so I've switched to an unsweetened almond instead. Most processed foods are now becoming largely unpalatable, or at least unpleasant. 

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, I lust for fresh fruit, vegetables, and nuts. A fresh crisp apple, a banana just turned ripe. A punnet of chilled blueberries. A handful of unroasted peanuts. Chilled cucumber, cut into strips. Mangoes, oh lawd, mangoes. The ultimate smoothie sensation when mixed with banana, flax, oats and almond milk. Almost reminds me of cake batter sometimes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hadn't realised just how much of affect that routine junk food was having on my palette. The oreos, blocks of chocolate, takeaway chips, cheap white bread. Particularly the sweet stuff which I would definitely call myself addicted to.

1597,jepp27,PlantBasedDiet,"TLDR: Fatigue, weak, always sore, can‚Äôt finish training. 

I‚Äôve been eating plant based for almost 4 years. Love it! I used to have knee and hip joint pain for years and started having chest pains when I was 20. After changing to plant based it all went away quickly and I never had it again. 
A bit more then half a year ago I decided that I‚Äôm going to just go 100% and went vegan. Not a lot changed cus I didn‚Äôt eat much animal product after being plant based in the first place. 
I used to train twice a day, and just once on weekends (I am an MMA fighter. Some fitness in the morning, classes in the evening) and I felt fine and progressed with strength and fitness. 
For about the last 3-4 months I‚Äôve been just feeling dead. Finishing a class or a training session is hard and I run out of gas, muscles feel weak and burned after the simplest things. I wake up sore every single day and it influences my life. Brain fog. It‚Äôs horrible. 
I tapered my training now to once a day and it still is the same, constantly tired, sore, and weak. A big thing I noticed too is I feel my heart beating now like it‚Äôs beating harder or louder, something that I never noticed before. I went to the doctor a couple of times already and done blood tests and I am perfect. Low Cholesterol, good iron levels, electrolytes, hormones and test. Everything looked perfect, the doctor had no answer. Last time though my blood pressure was considered high but there was no mention of it after. 
I usually eat as follows: 
Breakfast - oatmeal with soy milk, hemp,chia,flax,walnuts and berries
Lunch and dinner are flexible but usually involve some starch, legumes, random veggies and leafy greens. 
I supplement with b12 and have a multivitamin everyday. I use creatine and sometimes I use protein. 
I eat very similar to what plantbasedathlete on YouTube eats. 

Would like to know if anyone has an idea or a similar experience with that.","Constant Fatigue and Weakness, for months already",1

For the past 2 months, Dad has been in and out of hospital after a stroke in mid August. I realised it was time for him to switch his diet because in the past two weeks, his blood pressure has skyrocketed to 200. 

Although taking myriad of pharmaceutical medication, he went for a CT and MRI scan yesterday. Prior to this the appointment, his blood pressure was on average 150. Now during the MRI, they put something in the drip which made his body become extremely hot assuming this was for the procedure. Since the appointment, his body has been off and then last night BP rocketed to 217. Trembles and shivvers, weakness and lethargy. 

This truly was a smack in my face that despite all this medication, this shit was only masking if not reducing his symptoms and not curing shit. So an anomaly or something out of the ordinary can really just kill the man at any given point in time if he were to miss his medication or take something that might not agree with him.

Garam masala is sometimes used on its own, but it can be mixed or used with other seasonings. By using the [**Sunrise Garam Masala**](https://sunrise.in/product/garam-masala-powder/) blend you can make your curries more delicious.

### What is Garam Masala?

Garam Masala is a mixture of ground spices that is used extensively in Indian cuisines. The spices of Garam Masala are usually toasted to bring out more aroma and flavor. The term masala means ‚Äòspices‚Äô and Garam means ‚Äòhot‚Äô and the powder form is mostly gluten-free and vegetarian.

### Origin of Garam Masala

It is always believed that Garam masala originated in Northern Indian dishes and is specially founded in Mughal dishes. Garam Masala is spread throughout the Indian subcontinent as well as in Iran and Pakistan.

### Different Varieties of Garam Masala

There is not a single Garam masala recipe, as the ingredients differ according to the region as well as most of the chef‚Äôs individual preferences. In northern India, especially in the Punjab region, garam masala has only had black pepper for a hot element and focuses on sweet and aromatic spices. This type of Garam masala will be in a mild form.

Now, in India‚Äôs southern part, the hotter the garam masala is likely to be as red chilies are mostly to be part of the blend. The spices also changed as to how it is common locally. Thus recipes are not only regional but also passed down through families. So learning to mix the spices is a matter of pride in India.

### What spices are included in Garam Masala?

Garam Masala is a blend of spices which include,

* Cinnamon sticks
* Green cardamom pods
* Coriander seeds
* Black peppercorns
* Bay leaves
* Cumin seeds
* Mace

### What does it taste like?

Garam masala adds sweetness, warmth, floral aroma and a touch of heat from the black pepper. It is intended to be fragrant spice as well as flavorful.

### Cooking with Garam Masala

The blended mixture is usually added near the end of cooking so that it adds an aroma to the dish. Some additional Garam masala may also be sprinkled on top of the dish. It is often not the only spice and seasoning used in the dish.

### What does Garam masala taste like?

Garam masala is a warm, fragrant spice blend with lots of layers of flavors. But every blend will not taste the same, but you will get some hints of cinnamon, cloves or peppercorns. Try some pinch of Sunrise Garam Masala on roasted vegetables, it will really taste better.

### Difference between curry powder and Garam masala.

They are completely different spice blends. Curry powder is often a mix of turmeric powder, ginger, and chili powder. But Garam masala is completely different from curry powder as it has a fragrant smell, and a pinch of masala can change the look and taste of the dish.

### Uses of Bengali‚Äô gorommoshla‚Äô

Bengal people don‚Äôt use Garam masala at the beginning of their cook. They add whole Garam masala at the start of the recipe, which needed the tempering of such spices. Bengalis also add Garam masala for marinating meats, and curries have a Garam masala texture in the end. Here are a few recipes where Bengali‚Äôs used Garam masala:-

* Murgir Jhol ( chicken curry)
* Maacher Kalia (fish curry)
* Basanti pulao ( yellow rice)
* Fulkopi diye Chingri maach (prawns cooked with cauliflower)\\

Garam masala is a spice mix that is used extensively in Indian cooking. It has a strong, peppery flavor which can be found at the [**Sunrise Online Shop**](https://sunrise.in/product/garam-masala-powder/). It would be best to use Sunrise Garam Masala because it is easy to store and provides added depth to dishes, and can be used in different dishes. Garam masala intends to balance out various flavors. Hence, when you add Garam masala in your dishes which bring out the flavor of the dish.

**Acid Rain and the pH Scale**

The pH scale measures how acidic an object is. Objects that are not very acidic are called basic. The scale has values ranging from zero (the most acidic) to 14 (the most basic). As you can see from the pH scale above, pure water has a pH value of 7. This value is considered neutral‚Äîneither acidic or basic. Normal, clean rain has a pH value of between 5.0 and 5.5, which is slightly acidic. However, when rain combines with sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides‚Äîproduced from power plants and automobiles‚Äîthe rain becomes much more acidic. Typical acid rain has a pH value of 4.0. A decrease in pH values from 5.0 to 4.0 means that the acidity is 10 times greater.

**How pH is Measured**

There are many high-tech devices that are used to measure pH in laboratories. One easy way that you can measure pH is with a strip of¬†[litmus paper](https://www3.epa.gov/acidrain/education/site_students/glossary.html#lit). When you touch a strip of litmus paper to something, the paper changes color depending on whether the substance is acidic or basic. If the paper turns red, the substance is acidic, and if it turns blue, the substance is basic.

Hi,

So before I start, I understand that alcohol is not to be leaned on heavily to help create a calorie surplus. I understand its detrimental effects for weight gain and overall health if used excessively. I understand that when you consume alcohol, the body stops/slows protein synthesis and around 75% of carb/fat oxidation to prioritize metabolizing and excreting alcohol (treating it as a toxin).

My question is: If I were to have 2 or 3 beers, should I count those beer calories in myfitnesspal? If my calorie surplus goal at the moment is 2700-2800, and if I am at around 2650 or so for the day before I sit down to have two or three miller lites (96 calories each), should those two or three miller lite calories be counted toward my surplus goal?  Im not asking if its OK to have beer, but should the calories themselves be counted toward my surplus goals?

Im finding that all of this is very nuanced :) All literature that I read explains potential health benefits from a drink or two each night, or what alcohol really does, or how to calculate its calories. I get that... but they are empty calories. You can apply them as carbs or fats with a simple equation, but is that accurate? I look at it as...if my body has 250 carbs to run through for energy and I add in another 50 carbs from...anything, i now have 300 carbs. If my body has 250 carbs to run through for energy and two beers, It has that to go through those two beers first until it gets to the 250 carbs...all the same in the end, right?

tldr; its Thanksgiving in a few days :).  I know its OK to ""cheat"" every so often, moderation wont hurt yadda yadda.

Abstract:
&gt; Vitamin E (Œ±-tocopherol) is recognised as a key essential lipophilic antioxidant in humans protecting lipoproteins, PUFA, cellular and intra-cellular membranes from damage. The aim of this review was to evaluate the relevant published data about vitamin E requirements in relation to dietary PUFA intake. Evidence in animals and humans indicates a minimal basal requirement of 4‚Äì5 mg/d of RRR-Œ±-tocopherol when the diet is very low in PUFA. The vitamin E requirement will increase with an increase in PUFA consumption and with the degree of unsaturation of the PUFA in the diet. The vitamin E requirement related to dietary linoleic acid, which is globally the major dietary PUFA in humans, was calculated to be 0¬∑4‚Äì0¬∑6 mg of RRR-Œ±-tocopherol/g of linoleic acid. Animal studies show that for fatty acids with a higher degree of unsaturation, the vitamin E requirement increases almost linearly with the degree of unsaturation of the PUFA in the relative ratios of 0¬∑3, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 for mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexaenoic fatty acids, respectively. Assuming a typical intake of dietary PUFA, a vitamin E requirement ranging from 12 to 20 mg of RRR-Œ±-tocopherol/d can be calculated. A number of guidelines recommend to increase PUFA intake as they have well-established health benefits. It will be prudent to assure an adequate vitamin E intake to match the increased PUFA intake, especially as vitamin E intake is already below recommendations in many populations worldwide.

&gt; The Institute of Medicine (IoM), as well as other agencies that provide dietary intake recommendations ‚Äì for example, the DACH-countries (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) ‚Äì appreciate the role of vitamin E in protecting PUFA from being oxidised

208,qw10yi,nutrition,"Hey there,

I think it's quite safe to say:

* Fats, of all macro nutrients, have the highest energy density. Decent amounts will result in unreasonable amount of energy intake and potential weight gain
* Saturated fat rich foods are prone to increase LDL cholesterol
* Saturated fat rich foods increase the risk of cardio vascular issues, LDL cholesterol also does
* Fats that aren't liquid at body temperature, also MCT, somehow fall into a controversial area of the scientific discourse. If you want to be completely safe you better don't go overboard on those

*Therefore there's the wide-spread recommendation to replace saturated fats with kinds of unsaturated fats wherever possible.*

But oftentimes reality gets in the way and **replacement** is not not a simple option. How about **addition** tho?

**TLDR**: **""To which extend can we compensate for undesired health effects of 'bad fats' by ADDITION of 'good fats'?""**

It's really hard to find any satisfactory information on this issue and I think it's a very interesting question to ask.

I mean. If you look into high quality nut / seed / mixes of oils, all of them at least contain small amounts of saturated fats. Theres a lot of mumbling about ""the mixture / acid profile matters"". And there is even a lot of products marketed in a direction of ""so many percent of 3 / 6 / 9 MCT etc"". I guess most of this is marketing bla. The apparent thing here is: These products all claim it actually is a good thing that they also include ""lesser quality fats"". Is this caused by the fact that it's hard to manufacture products that are free of ""lesser quality fats"" - so it's actually white washing a production-necessity?

Let me also propose the following thought experiment: A bunch of healthy adults who work out several times a week are being fed on lasagna and salami pizza for lunch for several months. All nice and trashy. Half of them eat the meals as is. The other ones soak it in linen / walnut / whatever oil and supplement with Fish / Krill oil or oil; while still maintaining perfectly even energy balance, probably by saving on energy on other meals. In other words: Both groups keep their energy intake about even with their energy consumption; we don't want to care about effects of weight change. Let's also pretend this will not have terrible psychological effects, I'm still novice at designing human experiments.

How would these groups' blood vessels, their coronary arteries, their cholestorol and triglyceride blood work look like? Since we got a shitton of hormones that are synthesized from fats - how about these levels as well?

Does anyone have a read up on this? While this is ofc a giant exaggeration, what would you conclude from the findings in terms of dietary advice?

I think it's very clear that there is nothing like a ""perfectly nutritional guilt free greek platter with creamy desserts"". However - if having it once in a while - will swallowing a few capsules or meanwhile sipping more nice fats clear your conscience? Or at least assist clearing your arteries?

254,qtvopx,nutrition,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Saturated fats are typically solid at room temperature because their fatty acids have no double bonds which means they are able to be packed densely. Saturated fats are found in foods such as butter, cured meats, sausages and coconut milk.  Consuming higher amounts of saturated fats contributes to elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease.(1) Reductions in saturated fat, and replacing it with carbohydrates or polyunsaturated fats(PUFA),  has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events by 17%. (2) There is also insufficient evidence that reducing saturated fat intakes has harmful effects.(2) However, There does not seem to be a causal effect as in saying saturated fats cause cardiovascular disease, instead an increase intake of saturated fats, also increases the risks of cardiovascular disease. To limit saturated fats from meats choose lower-fat and lean options of dairy, meat and poultry. Some examples of dietary shifts can also include cooking with olive/avocado oil instead of butter or margarine and consume grilled chicken instead of fried. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends limiting saturated fats to 10% or less of your daily calories.(3)

I Am interested about sugar timings. I read complex carbs are better than sugars, but you still need to eat fruits, I read 2 fruits in the morning, then 3 vegetables afternoun... But problem is already 2 pieces of fruit can meet RDA!  So then if you eat like potatoes, would you need to cut 1 fruit e.g. When you exercise, it sugar RDA can be little bit higher I read, so it could be okay. But one has to track carb contents in all kinds of foods! Also shouldn't sugar intakes be more spaced out? Because I read in some study/guideline that you are supposed to eat 2 fruits in the morning (because insulin or something) but then whole afternoun you won't have much sugars, if any! Max like potatoes, but that's it, so you don't overdo it...

There is multiple things to consider, I would be interested in proper sugar timings (so they are spaced out during day and balanced) and how much fruits to eat per day, perhaps when you choose 1 high on sugar, you choose 2nd low in sugar to meet 2 fruits per day etc.

I need to drink more water (a LOT more than I currently do, not just for dieting reasons but also other health related reasons my doctor told me) + I found I remember to drink a lot more when it has some flavor to it. I make tea while at home but sometimes I'm in a hurry to go out and don't have tea ready. If I just grab a normal bottle of water, I end up barely drinking it.

I noticed a section with basically flavored water.

I am limiting my calorie count but another 100calories every once in a while I can just substitute for my daily snack so it's not an issue.

Are they healthy-ish, other than the added sugar, or is there anything else to watch for (like how diet sodas contain some very unhealthy chemicals, like aspertame)?

Are the ""vitamins"" listed actually anything, or is it such a small amount that it's practically just there for the marketing?

Are ones like the 2nd link ""more sugar than water"" like some of the old posts mentioned (I am still new to nutrition label reading, apologies if it is a dumb question)?

What I find interesting is how much low fat eating has fallen out of favor among the general population. As somebody prescribed such a diet, it's difficult to find recipes or information about it online without encountering a slew of articles talking about how science has reversed course and we now know that certain fats are considered healthy.

At 32, I'm not old enough to remember a time when low fat diets *were* in vogue. But I understand that it wasn't all that long ago that they were considered the normative ""healthy eating"" advice irrespective for everybody.

My question is when, approximately, did that shift in thinking occur? Are there still any reputable bodies that advocate for this way of eating? Or has the tide truly shifted against low fat?",When did low fat diets fall out of favor in the nutritional world?,0

499,qig1pn,nutrition,"**TL;DR:** Which is the least toxic form of inorganic selenium supplement for infant formulas: selenite, or selenate?

...

Regarding the relative health benefits, and potential toxicity, of selenite, and selenate...

...

For some reason, these two forms of inorganic selenium are the only two that are approved by the FDA for inclusion in human baby formulas.

Even though neither are in human breast milk or umbilical chord serum, which contain only organic forms of selenium, such as:

* peptidyl-selenocysteine (pronounced cystEEn) as found in glutathione peroxidase and selenoalbumin;

* selenocystamine;

* selenocystine (pronounced cystEYEn);

and other organo-selenium metabolites, including:

* methylselenocysteine,

* even free selenocysteine (highly reactive),

* and even the selenium-containing methionine homologue selenomethionine (which can sometimes infiltrate methionine-containing peptides and cause them to malfunction).

Source:

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349726634_Digging_deeper_into_the_mother-offspring_transfer_of_selenium_through_human_breast_milk

I read in some studies that selenite is more toxic to rats than selenate, and also that selenite has a lower absorption rate than selenate in humans. (Presumably at least in part because selenate can be uptaken via an identical pathway that is used to absorb sulfate.)

Yet, most ""hypoallergenic"" baby formulas seem to use selenite rather than selenate.

The more oxidized selenate would seem to be a stronger oxidizer, I would guess... and if oxidative damage is the main reason the inorganic forms are less absorbable and have more potential to do damage, then I would hedge towards the safety of selenite as well...

But then, un-bound selenium, selenide, and selenol (R-SeH) (non-peptidyl) are also potentially dangerously reactive, and maybe selenite is one reactive step closer to forming something like that, than the extra-oxygen-bearing selenate...

(And according to the following source, this is apparently the case, selenite having a tendency to spawn free selenide.)

https://www.ilifelink.com/selenium_supplementswhy_selenate_rates_and_selenite_bites.html

Selenate, on the other hand, is apparently the inorganic form of selenium naturally uptaken from soil by plants.

So is selenate actually the safer of the only two baby-formula FDA-approved (both inorganic) forms of supplemental selenium? &gt;!(And, why are the breastmilk-identical forms of selenium such as selenocystine and selenocystamine not FDA approved for inclusion in infant formulas? Have they perhaps not been proven to keep well? Do they perhaps spoil easily, and/or react with other components of the formula powders as they sit in storage?)!&lt;

For about a month and a half I haven't been able to eat properly. My diagnosis is ongoing, my doctor made me take a bunch of different drugs but nothing worked, so no one really knows what's wrong with me. 

The thing is I lift weights and I'm pretty obsessed with it. So I have to consume a lot of calories and protein every day in order to maintain my strength and muscle mass. But I can't eat anything. I can't eat too much fat (at least not more than I have lately), I'm scared of eating more sugar than I already am because of diabetes  and I can't eat too much in general, I used to eat 3500 calories and now am down to 3000 or less and it already looks like I'm eating half as much. I only choose super caloric, high-protein food but it still feels like it's too much. And whenever I go lower than that I lose strength and suck at the gym. 

So my question is : what is not too fat, not too sweet and super easy to eat that isn't in my diet in your opinion ? And if possible rich in protein

539,qgabie,nutrition,"I read this in a [Harvard publication](https://www.helpguide.org/harvard/vitamins-and-minerals.htm):

&gt; Major minerals travel through the body in various ways. Potassium, for example, is quickly absorbed into the bloodstream, where it circulates freely and is excreted by the kidneys, much like a water-soluble vitamin. Calcium is more like a fat-soluble vitamin because it requires a carrier for absorption and transport.

Does this mean potassium needs to be replenished more frequently, while excess calcium can be stored for later use? Which other minerals circulate and get excreted like water-soluble vitamins?

Also, the article says:

&gt; Contrary to popular belief, some water-soluble vitamins can stay in the body for long periods of time. You probably have several years‚Äô supply of vitamin B12 in your liver. And even folic acid and vitamin C stores can last more than a couple of days.

&gt; Generally, though, water-soluble vitamins should be replenished every few days.

Is this a broadly accepted consensus? Would this mean, for example, that there's no benefit in splitting a multivitamin and taking it twice a day vs. taking it all at once? Or that having a whole day's worth of B and C vitamins in one meal is just as good as spacing them across the day?

I feel many newer proponents may have come after a certain big youtuber made a video on them, but the idea has been around for a while. I want to set the record straight. Or, at the minimum, have a post I can link back to for when this topic pops up again. 

There are *many* studies on seed (and similar vegetable) oils so I don't want to shotgun a million of them in an exhaustive list. I'll do my best to stick to meta-analyses, systematic reviews and one massive cohort.

First is a prospective analysis of over half a million retired people. Each lipid source is estimated separately, dosage estimated via questionnaire using frequency and serving size, they found:

&gt; [Consumption of butter and margarine was associated with higher total and cardiometabolic mortality. Replacing butter and margarine with canola oil, corn oil, or olive oil was related to lower total and cardiometabolic mortality. Our findings support shifting the intake from solid fats to non-hydrogenated vegetable oils for cardiometabolic health and longevity.](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-021-01961-2)

Not an outright healthy or unhealthy finding as finding a control with no oils, butter or margarine whatsoever is likely very difficult. But as compared to butter and margarine, seed oils come out on top.


To precede anyone warming up their fingers to tell me epidemiology is bogus, questionnaires suck and correlation doesn't equal causation, I'll follow up with a meta-analysis of RCTs that support the findings. But I will point out that researchers are aware that correlation doesn't necessarily mean causation, so they go to great lengths to carry out multivariate analyses to account for confounding variables. It's not perfect, but this is the world of nutrition science. Anyway:

&gt; [Despite limitations in these data, our NMA findings are in line with existing evidence on the metabolic effects of fat and support current recommendations to replace high saturated-fat food with unsaturated oils.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002222752033546X)

Top quality stuff here. However I have seen this meta-analysis criticized because it only measured risk factors and didn't actually wait for enough people to die of heart attacks. To which I say, tough t*tties, we know full well these are risk factors and the scientific consensus on them is very clear.

One last one. The main proposed idea behind seed oils being so bad for you is that they have highly inflammatory omega-6 fatty acids, typically in the form of linoleic acid (LA).

I do not eat many fats either. I fill up on high fiber foods and protein. 

Ex: Yesterday

Breakfast: 4 eggs with cottage cheese, bell pepper, mushroom and two slices of bacon for breakfast. Low carb tortilla &amp; Coffee, (cream only.)

Lunch: Protein bar and later on turkey bites. 

Dinner: Blackened Tilapia with cilantro, lots of green &amp; red cabbage, avocado, ff sour cream with 2 low car tortillas.

Evening Snack:
2 pickle spears, 2 cups of unsweetened almond coconut milk and 14 grams of lilys chocolate chips. (stevia cc)

I eat a lot of vegetables on a daily basis but specifically low carb ones. Lots of mushrooms, spinach, salad blends, cucumbers, avocado, poblano or bell pepper.
I eat tuna steak,  tilapia or salmon about 2 -3 times a week.
Otherwise it is chicken breast, sometimes turkey meat. I do not really ever eat red meats but on a rare occasion. The only pork I eat is bacon but I have eaten turkey bacon in the past no problem. I could switch back.

l do not eat oatmeal, rice or and grains currently unless I can find low carb bread. 
I do not drink animal based milks but I do use cottage cheese daily and I will use cheeses. (parmesean, sharp cheddar and sometimes cream cheese.) Oh wait, I have 1 tbsp of heavy cream daily.

One of us is saying that nutrients are nutrients and calories are calories.

Also carbs for example and other nutrients are processed the same whether they are from beer or pasta. So eating your daily calories in food or fasting and drinking many beers instead isn‚Äôt a lot different.

The other one of us says that not all calories are equal and even though you could possibly have a higher carb percentage in your diet if you fasted and drank 15 beers for example, that those calories would be processed differently by your body and that somehow or another it could be as if you consumed less in total that day.

However, someone mentioned to me that it isn't a cause of concern, as over time the gut bacteria will adapt to the amount of phytates consumed and the former problem eventually goes away. He also mentioned that since phytate rich foods contain fiber which promote good gut bacteria growth, they increase nutrition absorption, and that consuming iron rich foods with Vtamin C (his way of saying having a varied diet) is what promotes nutrition absorption overall.

Does that mean like...processed foods/meals?  For example, a McDonalds chicken nugget?  


Or does it mean whole foods? For example, the whole chicken you buy at the grocery.

Or is it mass-farmed foods: For example, NOT necessarily the chicken your grandma caught in the chicken coop and plucked for dinner.  
IF it's whole foods? What causes it? Is it soil depletion, lack of variety/over-domestication, or farming methods?  


Like, if you grew corn in your backyard, or have an apple tree, or bought a cow that you got a local small time farmer to raise free-ish range, is that 30% less nutritious in the way that the McDonald's burger might be, or a mass-farmed apple might be?

Apologies if this is the wrong sub, I'm new here.  I'd love some help settling an argument about alcohol as an energy source or macronutrient!

My contention is that alcohol provides energy, and therefore counts as a macronutrient and against daily calorie count.

The other side says that it cannot be stored and therefore doesn't count.

I further say that though it cannot be stored, it prevents burning of either circulating or stored calorie sources and therefore should be counted.

But plenty of bodybuilders and fit people don't follow a low carb diet and don't do intermittent fasting (quite the opposite - they eat small meals every 3-4 hours). I would guess their muscle glycogen levels remain fairly high and their insulin levels remain moderate.

However, these folks are still able to lose fat, as long as they eat enough protein in their diet, keep training, and maintain a caloric deficit.

This seems to conflict with the advice that fasting and/or low carb is the only way to burn fat. So my question to redditors is what really controls when fat is burned vs. when muscle glycogen is burned for energy.

Even so, theoretically (from the little theories I know), I don't see why that would be necessarily a bad idea, say, if you plan to go powerlifting or some intense fast energy-burning activity as soon as that sugar begins spiking, in which the timing of that spiking would be certainly dictate everything (the follow-up question I wanted to ask).

One frequent answer I get online -- ""because sugar has no nutritional value"" isn't the answer I'm looking for.

996,pvr73g,nutrition,"from wikipedia:

The thermic effect of food is the energy required for digestion, absorption, and disposal of ingested nutrients. Its magnitude depends on the composition of the food consumed:

- Carbohydrates: 5 to 15% of the energy consumed
- Protein: 20 to 30%
- Fats: at most 5 to 15%

Let's consider averages since the exact amount depends on the type of macros that you're consuming: if the TEF wasn't accounted for, consuming the same amount of carbs or protein would technically have the same calories, but thanks to the TEF proteins should have an average difference of 15% less energy (22.5% - 7.5%).

So: 

- 400 grams of carbs would have 1600 - 120 = 1480 kcals
- 400 grams of proteins would have 1600 - 360 = 1240 kcals","When we say that carbs, fats, proteins have respectively 4, 9, 4 kcals/g, is the TEF already accounted for?",0

I've noticed that when I have a meal of primarily oats or primarily potatoes, I feel very full but become hungry a couple hours later. I googled it out of interest and continually came across references to how this also occurs with rice, bread, and pasta (due to blood sugar spikes from all the carbs) but for me, that's not the case. If I have a couple of cups of flavored rice or cheesy pasta, I'm not only full, I'm good for a long while! So why do I experience this with only potatoes and oats? I make sure to pair them with other things to get complete proteins, and I have plenty of fiber and healthy fats in my diet. I don't portion my food and just eat until I'm satisfied, so volume isn't the issue.

With potatoes, I'll even have a couple of mouthfuls and then feel full again! Is there some psychological/physiological trick to potatoes and oats that other carbs don't have? I was thinking that for oats the high fiber may make the calories nutritionally unavailable and so create a 'false' sense of fullness, but I don't see how potatoes differs much from rice or pasta.

He does have a strong bias towards a predominately meat-based diet, this is also evident from the fact that in a video he tried to downplay the effects of animal products on the climate, by citing a study that was incredibly poorly designed, which any sensible person would know if he read through the study. 

I'm of course not here to talk about the link between diet and the climate as it isn't the purpose of this sub, I'm just trying to explain that he clearly does have a strong bias.

# Here's why I believe that cholesterol is implicated in the etiology of heart disease

üì∑

I often see articles or post by people who are skeptic that dietary cholesterol and serum cholesterol play an important role in the initiation and progression of coronary artery diseases. Here‚Äôs why I believe that dietary cholesterol and high serum cholesterol do increase cardiovascular risk, hoping we can have a healthy discussion about this issue.

First, I want to address two popular claims.

First claim which comes in many variations

&gt;Cholesterol is essential for health ergo you need it

This claim actually implies that somehow it would be possible to have no cholesterol, and that this is what some people are recommending. The irony here is that these same people are always repeating that the body makes all the cholesterol it needs (when saying that dietary cholesterol has no impact on serum cholesterol). So why would it matter to eat zero cholesterol?

It also implies, as done by many people, that since it is essential to life, it is not possible to have too much of it and you should not care about hypercholesterolemia.

I hope anyone here can see the absurdity of that claim. No one is claiming that cholesterol is not essential to life. What is being claimed is that supra-physiological level of cholesterol is a problem, in the same way that supra-physiological level of glucose is problematic, and in the same way as supra-physiological level of iron is problematic, both of which are also essential to life.

That kind of binary, black and white thinking should be a big red flag right of the start.

Another important claim to get out of the way

&gt;Low-cholesterol actually *increases* mortality

There is actually very little evidences for that claim, and many evidences showing the contrary, and this claim is usually done using very weak ecological data, such as this [one](http://perfecthealthdiet.com/2011/06/blood-lipids-and-infectious-disease-part-i/).

Just take a look at this graph and it‚Äôs obvious what‚Äôs going on : people that die the most of CHD on this graph are all from poor countries, with little access to good medical care, whereas people that die less from CHD are all from rich countries with top medical care such as Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Danemark‚Ä¶ etc etc. Don‚Äôt let that kind of weak data confuse you.

First, there is a well known reverse-causation when it comes to low-cholesterol and mortality, ie, many diseases actually cause cholesterol to go down, which could make it seems like low-cholesterol is linked to mortality. Here are references for this [1](http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/92/9/2396), [2](http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/92/9/2365).

There is [little evidences](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17697899) that lowering LDL-c increases non-CHD related mortality.

Also, there are evidences that people with low-cholesterol level throughout life actually have increased lifespan. [1](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/192897), [2](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0026049597900044)

Now, let‚Äôs get down to the matter : why do I believe that cholesterol is implicated in the initiation and progression of artery diseases?

There are multiple lines of evidences for this, going back as far as the early 1900‚Äôs.

**Line of evidence #1 : Cholesterol feeding in animal model (including herbivores, omnivores and carnivores) consistently lead to narrowing of the arteries.**

It all started when [one researcher](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1764970/) fed rabbit a diet rich in cholesterol and realized they were quickly developing atheroma.

One critic that cholesterol-skeptic like to make is that this can be discarded since rabbit are herbivorous and are not well adapted to a high-cholesterol diet. Well, since then, these same results have been replicated in herbivores, omnivores, carnivores, and many primates species. [1](http://atvb.ahajournals.org/content/26/2/242.full), [2](http://scialert.net/abstract/?doi=ijps.2004.671.684), [3](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021915073900257), [4](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021915074900409),[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9389784),[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1903425/) Cholesterol feeding then become, in animal research the *sine qua non*, which mean essential condition, to induce atherosclerosis. This is all very well accepted within the scientific community, there are no doubt about this relation and the efficacy of high-cholesterol feeding to induce atherosclerosis. In comparison, sucrose has never been shown experimentally to be able to induce atherosclerosis in the absence of cholesterol in the diet.

And this point is actually of high importance because dietary cholesterol is probably more strongly linked to cardiovascular risk than serum cholesterol. In [animal model](http://circres.ahajournals.org/content/circresaha/34/4/447.full.pdf), it was possible to induce atherosclerosis with a low-supplemented cholesterol diet, even if the serum cholesterol did not raise much.

As the authors note

&gt;This study was focused on changes in the arterial intima of a nonhuman primate after administration of dietary cholesterol at levels far below those used conventionally to induce experimental atherosclerosis. The intimal changes observed were correspondingly much smaller. The regimen for group 1 was originally designed to demonstrate a null point of the effect of dietary cholesterol on the arterial intima. However, such a point was not found; no threshold for dietary cholesterol was established with respect to a putatively adverse effect on arteries.

Meaning that any amount of cholesterol above zero was increasing plaque buildups.

This point is important to consider and remember.

**Line of evidence #2 : People with genetic polymorphisms that have genetically low-cholesterol level have a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease**

Mendelian randomized studies are studies that looked at the effect of certain gene polymorphisms with a known effect on a given outcome. It makes it possible to avoid classic confounding factor problems in epidemiological studies.

There are many genes that are linked to low-cholesterol level. Many mendelian studies have found that people with such genes suffer far less from CHD. [1](http://www.onlinejacc.org/content/60/25/2631), [2](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa054013#t=abstract), [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25770315).

&gt;All 9 polymorphisms were associated with a highly consistent reduction in the risk of CHD per unit lower LDL-C, with no evidence of heterogeneity of effect (I2 = 0.0%). In a meta-analysis combining nonoverlapping data from 312,321 participants, naturally random allocation to long-term exposure to lower LDL-C was associated with a 54.5% (95% confidence interval: 48.8% to 59.5%) reduction in the risk of CHD for each mmol/l (38.7 mg/dl) lower LDL-C. This represents a 3-fold greater reduction in the risk of CHD per unit lower LDL-C than that observed during treatment with a statin started later in life (p = 8.43 √ó 10‚àí19). [1](http://www.onlinejacc.org/content/60/25/2631)

**Line of evidence #3 : Drugs and other lifestyle intervention that reduce cholesterol consistently reduce cardiovascular incidences and mortality**

Statins and other drugs that decrease cholesterol by differing mechanisms consistently show decreased CHD incidences and mortality [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2645847/), [2](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2556125). Some people have critic statins by saying that they have pleiotropic effects, which is true. But there are some other means of reducing LDL-cholesterol that have no known pleiotropic effect and that still results in reduced CHD risk.

LDL-apheresis is the process of filtrating the LDL-c molecule of the blood of patient. It‚Äôs mainly used in people with FH (see below). This process, which usually result in a large decrease in LDL-c level, also result in a large decrease in CHD risk for these individuals [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9874053).

&gt;LDL apheresis significantly reduced LDL cholesterol levels **from 7.42+/-1.73 to 3.13+/-0.80 mmol/L (58%)** compared with group taking drug therapy, from 6.03+/-1.32 to 4.32+/-1.53 mmol/L (28%). With Kaplan-Meier analyses of the coronary events including nonfatal myocardial infarction, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass grafting, and death from CHD, **the rate of total coronary events was 72% lower in the LDL-apheresis group** (10%) than in drug therapy group (36%) (p=0.0088).

**Line of evidence #4: People with a genetic defect that suffer from very high cholesterol level (familial hypercholesterolemia) die very young of heart diseases. Decreasing cholesterol level in these individual greatly increase their survival odds.**

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic defect that results in very high LDL-cholesterol in the blood.

Unfortunately for these people, their risk of suffering from a cardiovascular event is greatly increased [1](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/160/5/421/74662/Familial-Hypercholesterolemia-and-Coronary-Heart).

&gt;The risk of fatal or nonfatal coronary heart disease by age 60 years was 52 percent for male and 31.8 percent for female relatives with FH compared with 12.7 percent and 9.1 percent for relatives without FH. [1](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/160/5/421/74662/Familial-Hypercholesterolemia-and-Coronary-Heart)

**Line of evidence #5: Population studies consistently show that life-time exposure to high cholesterol level is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and mortality.**

Pretty self-explanatory. Epidemiological and population studies found a strong link between high serum cholesterol and CHD. [1](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/389185)

So basically we have strong evidences that :

* Cholesterol feeding in animal (across many different species) causes atherosclerosis
* People with genetically low cholesterol level that die less of coronary heart disease
* People with genetically high cholesterol level that die very young of heart disease
* Drug and other lifestyle intervention that reduce cholesterol level decrease CHD risk
* Population studies that consistently show that people with high cholesterol level develop and suffer more from coronary artery diseases.

What other explanation than cholesterol could explain all those observations? What could be another connecting factors else than cholesterol for all of this?

Now, nobody here is saying that cholesterol is the *only* risk factors. Anything that increases injuries to the arterial wall and causes inflammation (high blood pressure, smoking, hyperglycemia, saturated fatty acid, infectious agent) will participate in the initiation and progression of the diseases, but it takes cholesterol and lipoproteins for the atherosclerosis plaque to form.

I hope this can lead to a healthy discussion about the issue, and that it can helps people understand why it matter to keep their cholesterol level within the normal range, which should be [under 150 mg/dl.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109704007168)

The link between high cholesterol and coronary artery diseases is regarded by many as one of the most solid link in modern biomedical science.

If we were looking at the [Bradford-Hill criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_Hill_criteria) for establishing a causation, the high-cholesterol-CHD link is consistent will all of the 9 criteria, which makes it very likely that the causation is real.

To quote Jeremiah Stamler (one of the leading researchers on cardiovascular diseases of the 20th century) in his [criticism](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/91/3/497.full) (highly recommended) of the [2010 meta-analysis regarding SFAs and CHD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20071648)

&gt;*In fact, the decisive dietary modification for experimental atherogenesis, the sine qua non or materia peccans (Anitschkow's term), is cholesterol ingestion. This has been the prerequisite since the 1908‚Äì1912 breakthrough by Anitschkow et al (a centennial anniversary meriting celebration and discussion) in thousands of experiments in mammalian and avian species‚Äîherbivorous, carnivorous, and omnivorous‚Äîincluding nonhuman primates.* ***To neglect this fact in a review about humans is to imply that the Darwinian foundation of biomedical research is invalid and/or that there is a body of substantial contrary evidence in humans. Neither is the case***

1171,ppg912,nutrition,"It seems in my study of nutrition, there's two prominent schools of thought, both advocating for eating less processed or whole foods.

1) the plant-based school of thought, that lots of diseases are caused by eating too many animal products.  And when people cut out animal products completely, their diseases reverse.  (the most radical example is Kempner's work where he got people to reverse diabetes, kidney disease, hypertension, and heart failure by eating only white rice and fruits and sugar)

2) the ketosis or paleo style school of thought that argues about the benefits of a lot of good quality fat from animal products when they're pasture raised, and the skepticism about consuming grains or in some cases all carbohydrates.  And I've heard of a lot of people having benefits from a keto diet when they cut out carbs as much as possible, consuming calories of mostly fats from butter, eggs, and meat (it seems like there's some studies of it reversing heart failure and diabetes).

My wondering is that since it seems there are benefits from cutting out carbs completely or cutting out animal fats completely, is there something about those two things not mixing well together in our body?  Or is it just the over-processing of them that's making things unhealthy (like with cereal/milk, hamburgers, and pizza)?",Do carbohydrates not mix well with animal fats or something?,0

But if it's a myth...that can only mean that protein can stay longer than common sources say so (6-8 hours) in the small intestine.

Say one eats 60 g of egg protein in one meal, which digests at around 3 g an hour. Would that protein stay in the small intestine for 20 hours, until it's all absorbed? Are there any studies looking at how much of a protein rich meal like this would be absorbed, and in how long?

If not, is there an upper limit to how long the protein would stay? Because if it indeed is only 6-8 hours, that would not only prove the 30 g per meal limit true, but actually make it an overstatement, as 3g per hour times 8 hours gives only a maximum of 24 grams absorbed.

Secondly, my functional medicine doctor recommended [https://bodybio.co.uk/products/bodybio-balance-oil](https://bodybio.co.uk/products/bodybio-balance-oil) \- but looking at it after my appointment, I notice it has sunflower oil.

I made this diet outline based on food science and what has been actually proven to enhance your body's various systems (cognitive, gastrointestinal, etc.). I've done my best to derive nutrients from natural sources and to minimize the use of supplements as part of the diet. Any scrutiny is welcomed because I'd like to remove any pseudo-science from the diet, let alone spread it. Food suggestions for the different categories are appreciated too. I hope this helps as a simplified nutritional guideline for those overwhelmed with the amount of information on ""healthy"" diets out there. You can find a breakdown of the benefits of the different compounds and why they were chosen as categories in the first comment.

**‚ÄúThe more ingredients there are, the worse it is for you‚Äù**

Avoid processed foods, always opt for the whole grain option, eat fruits and vegetables and try to eat more vegetable-based protein and less animal protein. That's about it.

**Background**:


I know the difference between natural sugar (fruit) and added sugar (processed food).
AFAIK, different health organizations sources suggest to consume less than 25 grams of added sugar per day. Others suggest instead to consume added sugar within a limit of 38 grams per day.

I think both of these informations are reliable regarding _added_ sugar. When I can avoid it, it‚Äôs better though.


**Questions:**

1. My aim is to reduce as much fat as possible (getting around 10% of body fat). Maximally, how many **grams** of natural sugar should be consumed per day?
2. MyFitnessPal suggests me to stay below the 92 grams limit of sugars. Why? Is this suggestion reliable at all for my aim I‚Äôve talked about in the last question?

**Background:** Although intake of Hass avocado has been cross-sectionally linked to lower abdominal obesity, knowledge of the effects of avocado consumption on abdominal adiposity and glycemic outcomes remains limited. 


**Objective:** The effects of avocado consumption on abdominal adiposity, insulin resistance, oral-glucose-tolerance test (OGTT), and estimated Œ≤-cell function were evaluated.


**Methods:** A total of 105 adults aged 25‚Äì45 y (61% female) with BMI ‚â•25 kg/m2 were randomly assigned to an intervention (N = 53) that received a daily meal with 1 fresh Hass avocado or a control (N = 52) that received an isocaloric meal with similar ingredients without avocado for 12 wk. DXA was used to assess the primary outcomes of abdominal adiposity [visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (SAAT), and the ratio of VAT to SAAT (VS Ratio)]. Fasted glucose and insulin were used to assess the primary outcomes of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index) and Œ≤-cell function (Insulinogenic index) were estimated using an OGTT. Changes between groups were compared using an ANCOVA. Secondary analyses were conducted based on sex.


**Results:** The control group exhibited a greater reduction in SAAT [‚Äì54.5 ¬± 155.8 g (control) compared with 17.4 ¬± 155.1 g (treatment), P = 0.017] and increase in VS Ratio [0.007 ¬± 0.047 (control) compared with ‚Äì0.011 ¬± 0.044 (treatment), P = 0.024]. Among females, the treatment group exhibited a greater reduction in VAT [1.6 ¬± 89.8 g (control) compared with ‚Äì32.9 ¬± 81.6 g (treatment), P = 0.021] and VS Ratio [0.01 ¬± 0.05 (control) compared with ‚Äì0.01 ¬± 0.03 (treatment), P = 0.001]. Among males, there was no significant difference between groups in changes in abdominal adiposity or glycemic outcomes.


**Conclusions:** Daily consumption of 1 fresh Hass avocado changed abdominal adiposity distribution among females but did not facilitate improvements in peripheral insulin sensitivity or Œ≤-cell function among adults with overweight and obesity. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02740439. J Nutr 2021;151:2513‚Äì2521.

1331,pjnkzr,nutrition,"Abstract

Our aim was to determine the effect of diet on gut microbiota, digestive function and sensations, using an integrated clinical, metagenomics and metabolomics approach. We conducted a cross-over, randomised study on the effects of a Western-type diet versus a fibre-enriched Mediterranean diet. In 20 healthy men, each diet was administered for 2 weeks preceded by a 2-week washout diet. The following outcomes were recorded: (a) number of anal gas evacuations; (b) digestive sensations; (c) volume of gas evacuated after a probe meal; (d) colonic content by magnetic resonance imaging; (e) gut microbiota taxonomy and metabolic functions by shotgun sequencing of faecal samples; (f) urinary metabolites using untargeted metabolomics. As compared to a Western diet, the Mediterranean diet was associated with (i) higher number of anal gas evacuations, (ii) sensation of flatulence and borborygmi, (iii) larger volume of gas after the meal and (iv) larger colonic content. Despite the relatively little difference in microbiota composition between both diets, microbial metabolism differed substantially, as shown by urinary metabolite profiles and the abundance of microbial metabolic pathways. The effects of the diet were less evident in individuals with robust microbiotas (higher beta-diversity). To conclude, healthy individuals tolerate dietary changes with minor microbial modifications at the composition level but with remarkable variation in microbial metabolism.

Phytic acid binds to important minerals such as zinc and iron, so your body doesn't actually end up getting to use these nutrients. Therefore, it's important to get rid of phytic acid before you consume the oats.

I'm a little baffled by this, given how commonly people say dark chocolate is very healthy, but it is also clearly pretty full of saturated fat, so is it ""good"" plant based sat fat, or is it just that people are expected to eat a small proportion of their calories in chocolate and thus the higher concentration isn't that big a deal?",chocolate and saturated fat,0

* Environmental mismatch is the root cause of chronic lifestyle diseases and the so-called diseases of modernity
* One of the most important mismatches is diet, namely replacing the ancestral diet rich in animal meat, fat, and organs with highly processed products of industrial mono-cropped agriculture: refined grains, sugar, and seed oils.
* dietary dictates of the past century overwhelmingly reflect the corporate interests of the Pharmaceutical Industry, the Food Industry, and the religious doctrine of the Seventh  Day Adventist Church.

Viewing the evidence, it appears consumption of fried foods and trans fats can cause mild birth defects that permanently harm cognition of offspring. It can be explained by neurotoxicity decreasing the ability of endogenous antioxidants[^(\[34\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC7231579/) and altering Omega 3 metabolism. This can lead to a weaker prefrontal cortex (PFC), enhanced addictive behavior and decreased cognition. Theoretically, this could directly play into the pathogenesis of ADHD, and its frequent occurrence.

In 2018 the FDA placed a ban on trans fats, when ironically the makers of partial hydrogenation were given a nobel prize in 1912. This post serves as a testament to the cruelty of modernity, its implications in cognitive dysfunction, and what you should stay away from.

**Trans fats, abundant in the western diet:**

* **Surprisingly common:** The temperature at which foods are fried renders common cooking oils trans fats.[^(\[1\])](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308814616309141)[^(\[2\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24033334/) Time worsens this reaction, though it transitions exponentially and within minutes. It is not uncommon for oil to be heated for hours. Given how inseperable fried food is from western cuisine, especially in low income areas (think fast food, southern cooking), this demands more attention.
* **Seasoning matters:** There appears to be mild evidence that frying at a lower heat, and with rosemary, can reduce trans fats formation supposedly due to antioxidant properties.[^(\[17\])](https://grasasyaceites.revistas.csic.es/index.php/grasasyaceites/article/view/689/700)

**The relationship of trans fats, polyunsaturated fats and mental disorders:**

* **Trans fats may cause an Omega 3 deficiency:** Omega 3s are primarily known for their anti-inflammatory effects, usually secondary to DHA and EPA. But there's more to it than that. Trans fats block the conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA.[^(\[3\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC4190204/) This means that in some, trans fats can upset Omega 3 function in a similar manner to a deficiency.
* **ADHD:** There is significant correlation betweens **ADHD** and trans fats exposure.[^(\[20\])](https://sci-hub.se/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1651-2227.2012.02726.x) It seems the inverse relationship between Omega 3s and trans fats is multifaceted. A major role of Omega 3s, and its relevance to **ADHD** is its potent neurotrophic activity in the PFC.[^(\[10\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC2844685/) Studies have found that **ADHD** is associated with weaker function and structure of PFC circuits, especially in the right hemisphere.[^(\[11\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC2894421/) Trans fats have a negative effect on offspring BDNF, learning and memory.[^(\[21\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25394793/) Omega 3s inhibit MAOB in the PFC[^(\[6\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9868201/), which decreases oxidative stress and toxicity from dopamine, and simultaneously inhibits its breakdown. Of less relevance, various MAOIs have been investigated as potential treatments for **ADHD**.[^(\[7\])](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/owmcgz/2003_seligiline_treats_adhd_with_less_side/)[^(\[8\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1546129/)[^(\[9\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10216387/) Unfortunately, most meta analyses concluded Omega 3 ineffective for **ADHD**, however they are majorly flawed as an Omega 3 deficiency is not cured until a minimal of 3 months.[^(\[22\])](https://sci-hub.se/https://www.jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567(11)00484-9/fulltext)[^(\[23\])](https://sci-hub.se/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022395618310185?via%3Dihub) Omega 3s have been proposed to help **ADHD** for a long time, but if they are to help through neurogenesis and a transition in pathways, it would be a long-term process. While **ADHD** may acutely function better with a low quality, dopamine-releasing diet containing trans fats[^(\[23\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6572510/) and while Omega 3s may, through anti-inflammatory/ anti-oxidant mechanisms, partially attenuate mother's offspring stimulant-induced increases in dopamine/ D1 density, downregulated D2 density[^(\[24\])](https://sci-hub.se/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12640-015-9549-5), this is not an argument in favor for trans fats or agaist Omega 3; rather, data hints at trans fat induced CDK5 activation, secondary to dopamine release. The mechanism by which trans fats may increase dopamine lead to dysregulation, as explained in posts prior to this one.[^(\[25\])](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/ovfzwg/a_sciencebased_analysis_on_dopamine_upregulation/)
* **Bipolar disorder:** DHA deficiency and thus lack of PFC protection is associated with **bipolar disorder**.[^(\[12\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC2838627/)  **Bipolar depression** is significantly improved by supplementary Omega 3s.[^(\[14\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21903025/) This could be largely in part due to the modulatory effect of Omega 3s on neurotransmitters.
* **Generalized anxiety:** Trans fat is linked to More trans fats in red blood cell fatty acid composition is associated with worse stress and **anxiety**. More Omega 3s and Omega 6s have positive effects.[^(\[15\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC7193237/) Trans fat intake during pregnancy or lactation increases **anxiety**\-like behavior and alters proinflammatory cytokines and glucocorticoid receptor levels in the hippocampus of adult offspring.[^(\[16\])](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0361923020307024) In addition, Omega 3s were shown to improve stress and **anxiety** in both healthy humans[^(\[27\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC3191260/) and mice[^(\[26\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6308198/). Some possible explanations are changes to inflammatory response, BDNF, cortisol, and cardiovascular activity.[^(\[28\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30264663/)
* **Autism:** Maternal intake of Omega 3s and polyunsaturated fats inversely correlates with **autism**, however trans fat intakes do not significantly increase chances after proper adjustment.[^(\[4\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23813699/)[^(\[18\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC3988447/) Maternal immune activation (MIA), mother fighting a virus/ bacteria during pregnancy, is thought to increase the risk of **autism** and **ADHD** in the offspring. A deficiency in Omega 3s during pregnancy worsened these effects, enhancing the damage to the gut microbiome.[^(\[5\])](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-020-00793-7) The data suggests trans fats have only a loose correlation with **autism**, whereas prenatal Omega 3 deficiency is more severe. Omega 3 supplementation can improve traits unrelated to functioning and social behavior.[^(\[19\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5634395/)

Sugar cravings can be difficult to overcome but intermittent fasting can help. When one begins fasting for the day, the hunger-suppressing hormone leptin levels initially increase, appetite decreases and sweet tooth desires lessen. 

When one stays in a fasted state for a long period, leptin levels start to drop. This may cause feelings of increased hunger and desires for sugar the first couple of weeks. As leptin levels normalize, hunger and sugar cravings subside and in time the sugar craving cycle can be broken.

I've read multiple studies (somewhat older). The best seemed to be the ""Lancet 2018 Hallmark Metastudy Risk thresholds for alcohol consumption: combined analysis of individual-participant data for 599‚Äà912 current drinkers in 83 prospective studies""
with the main conclusion being ""In comparison to those who reported drinking &gt;0‚Äì‚â§100¬†g per week, those who reported drinking &gt;100‚Äì‚â§200 g per week, &gt;200‚Äì‚â§350 g per week, or &gt;350 g per week had lower life expectancy at age 40 years of approximately 6 months, 1‚Äì2 years, or 4‚Äì5 years, respectively.  Associations were similar for men and women (appendix p 26), but weaker at older ages (appendix p 27)."".

Moderate consumption is around one to two drinks a day, or a total of 7 to 14 drinks a week which boils down to 100-200gr alcohol a week if my mathematics are correct.

I am in that range, drinking 1 to 3 drinks on 3 to 5 days a week, and would like to continue doing so. What are the newest insights in the harmfulness of this level of consumption and any ways to help mitigate or minimise any harm beyond reducing alcohol?

1462,pf0mnk,nutrition,"So I recently learned that for centuries, working people in Europe ate their most significant meal during the afternoon. Breakfast would be something that's readily available in the morning like eggs, dairy or something that could be prepared overnight without any oversight like oats. Dinner would be enjoyed in the afternoon and be a heavy meal that consist of fish, meat, veggies and carbs to fuel yourself for heavy labor throughout the day and supper would be a light meal of bread, soup, cured meats, etc. 

It became fashionable for the upper classes (aka people who did jack shit all day) to start postponing dinner later and later until they ended up eating dinner in the evening. The industrial revolution sealed the deal because strict work times meant the working class only had time for quick, prepared lunches during the afternoon. 

When you think about it it makes little sense, why would you eat light before the busiest time of the day and then fill yourself up to just lie around and sleep? That's how you end up with late afternoon sugar dips. I would even go as far as to speculate that not being full during the busiest time of day is a big factor when it comes to overeating.

**What is lactose intolerance?**

It is when our bodies cannot break down a sugar found in milk called lactose.

Our bodies use an enzyme called lactase to break down that sugar so we can absorb it into our bodies. But people with lactose intolerance don‚Äôt have enough lactase. It‚Äôs produced in the small intestine.

Around 40% of people are lactose intolerant from the age of 2 and can cause things like gas, bloating and diarrhea.

Many people don‚Äôt know that lactose intolerant people can have many forms of dairy without the nasty side affects.

For instance: Extra Mature Cheddar, Parmigiano Reggiano, Comt√© are all hard cows cheeses which (if aged enough) have very little to no lactose compared to milk, butter, or soft cows cheeses. This is because the aging process converts lactose into lactic acid. 

https://www.nutrition.org.uk/nutritionscience/allergy/lactose-intolerance.html?start=2

You see it especially with very aged parmigiana reggiano - little crystals forming which signs of that conversion. 

Other cheeses are those made with Goats milk, sheep‚Äôs milk, or buffalo milk  haven‚Äôt got substantially lower amounts of lactose but due to having a different protein and fat makeup, anecdotal evidence suggests that these milks and their cheeses may be easier to digest. 


https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/does-goat-milk-have-lactose#lactose-in-goat-milk

Of course if you have a dairy allergy you can‚Äôt have any of those cheeses or dairy, and someone who has a severe intolerance should still avoid all dairy but it‚Äôs worth telling your friends who are lactose intolerant, that there‚Äôs a wide variety of cheeses that they can (probably) digest very well.

Yours sincerely, a lactose intolerant cheese fanatic.

1472,pehw4p,nutrition,"A specific example would be something like Ensure. One ensure plus drink has about as much sugar added to it as you'll find in a medium apple. Because of this it gets a lot of flack. However, from everything I read, the only explanation I can find as to why sugar in fruit is better for you than added is sugars, is because the fruit comes paired with fiber and other nutrients, which slows the absorption of glucose, which means you don't get the insulin spike. If that is true, then is there really any real difference between consuming the ensure, and consuming the fruit? The ensure has protein, fat, and fiber added (some of them at least.) so it is paired with these things.

One caveat here, is I realize the ensure won't have the antioxidants a fruit will have.

This sugar issue confuses me because I see people saying sugar should be limited, but that fruits are OK and an exception. That doesn't make much sense to me. Should I limit sugar or not?

I find this confusing too because the argument about fruits being healthier than regular sugar plus a fiber supplement is because the fiber molecules are embedded in the sugars, so would that mean that if you don't eat the skin then you are only losing out on essential nutrients and not necessarily spiking your blood sugar because the fiber within the flesh is the only fiber that is embedded in the sugars/carbohydrates?",Is eating fruits/vegetables without the skin the equivalent of eating refined grained?,0

1512,pcrwjw,nutrition,"## We need to talk about anti-science misinformation

It's one thing when there are conflicting opinions and conclusions regarding some specific area of nutrition.  That's fine and is ideal for participants here to throw back and forth. It's another thing altogether when someone is wholly anti-science.  We're not talking about cases of ""is this a 6 or a 9"", we're talking about cases of ""there are no numbers""

Science is real.  Science is necessary.  This sub is for and about the science of nutrition. While it is not the subreddit's place to enforce a side in disagreements over interpretations of data / studies / research, we feel it is incumbent upon us to address anti-science narratives. 

It is not informative, helpful, or productive when someone comes to this sub and is not engaging in facts, is utterly resistant to providing any facts, is solely reliant on youtube videos as a basis for their claims, and ultimately responds to any debate with conspiracy claims.   A completely fact resistant mindset based on gut feelings and ""somebody dun sed an I dont care who"" is not engaging in good faith whatsoever.

While we sympathize with concerns about corporate interests, it is a problem when folks are coming here to specifically bash any and all science and try to discredit every bit of it with ""funding bias"" and ""Big food and Big pharma"" kinds of comments. THE biggest problem misinformation angle in the nutrition sub are science rejection comments, and not just rejection of some specific thing but those which are actively promoting ""don't trust any science"". 

Again, the science of any specific facet of nutrition is always welcomed to be debated here, it's part of the purpose of the sub, but a debate of the validity of science itself is not.

Therefore, going forward;

* **""Science is a conspiracy"" type engagement is not allowed** - If instead of having a fact based discussion, your purpose here is to engage solely in unsubstantiated conspiracy generalizations and science denial, then you are likely to be banned. If conspiracy claims are your basis for discussion or you wish to question science itself, then you should instead utilize the subreddits which cater to those discussions as it is not on topic for this sub.

* **Automod will be removing certain kinds of anti-science and conspiracy comments**.  This will be very targeted to science denial rhetoric so as to ensure appropriate topical debate is left in place.

* **Any bias concerns need to be *specifically* addressed and cited rather than barfing up generalized funding bias hyperbole**. Pointing out a specific company or companies behind a specific study to express concerns about bias is more than acceptable for discussion here.  Blanket brushing all science / research / studies ever generated for funding bias is ridiculous conspiracy blather and is outside of reality.  It's a step way too far.

In addition to the above, we also ask you to vote accordingly and to let us know when you see

""all science BAD!""  
""all studies are a conspiracy and are biased!""  
""everything is a conspiracy!""

My question is then - are other fiber rich foods with similar sugar content just as OK as whole fruit? An average banana has 14 grams of sugar and 3 grams of fiber. That's 4.66 sugars per gram of fiber. An indie granola brand has 6 grams of sugar per serving, and 2 grams of fiber = 3 sugars per gram of fiber.

Ounce for ounce, is this granola a healthier option than the banana?

* Calories: 230 vs 332 (102 less calories)
* Total Fats: 14g vs 30g (16 grams less)
* Saturated Fats: 5g vs 11g (6 grams less)

1609,p9h5x0,nutrition,"I'm on a budget, and routinely get turkey/chicken, so this question comes up a lot in my head.

I found a brand I respect and like, and they offer an organic version of their products, and a regular version. 

Both versions are **exactly** the same, (same housing, natural growth/slaughtering times, same pasture fields, no hormones, no antibiotics, same food, treatment etc...) except for the one distinction being that the organic version feeds the livestock with non-gmo feed, whereas the organic (obviously) feeds the livestock with purely organic feed. (keep in mind the non-organic feed still does not have hormones/stimulants/antibiotics).

The organic products are however like 3 dollars more expensive, and that adds up tremendously when budgeting and often as much as I do.

So my question is, considering all other aspects of the turkey/chicken are the same, is non-organic feed a serious deal breaker, and worth putting extra money towards organic feed?

\*‚ÄúSurprisingly, we overeat fats and carbs not because the appetites for these nutrients are stronger, but because the appetite for¬†*protein*¬†is strongest of all! If protein is diluted in the food supply, we overeat until we satisfy our protein appetite. On high-protein diets, the protein appetite will be satisfied sooner‚Äîwhen fewer total calories have been eaten. This is what we call the Protein Leverage effect.

‚ÄúBut more protein is not necessarily better. Eating too much protein switches on biological processes that hasten aging and shorten lives.‚Äù

1729,p4tg9c,nutrition,"Each state has its own rules for the cultivation, sale and use of medicinal cannabis. Despite a doctor's recommendation you must follow the law if you use cannabis.

Most shops will have to check your medical cannabis card for entry in their authorization file. If you apply as a GP, the patient may need to come to your appointment. 

The laws on medical cannabis vary from state to state, but steps to become an authorized patient of medical marijuana are the same. Finding a licensed pharmacy in a state where cannabis is legal for medicinal purposes is easy. If a pharmacy accepts a valid card outside the state, read the section below to learn more about the laws of reciprocity. 

Most states have on their government websites a page with their cannabis laws, information on registration for a health card and a list of licensed dispensaries. For example, in New York, a state used exclusively for medical purposes, there are ten pharmacies with stores in four locations.

In the United States there are several dispensaries where patients can buy medical marijuana. Patients must present their medical marijuana license, medical recommendation, and valid ID as proof of identity. The purchase of medical cannabis from a licensed pharmacy is important to ensure a high quality product.

Medical marijuana can be found in capsule form, just like any other over-the-counter or prescription drug. Patients are advised by their doctor to grow a certain amount of medical marijuana, which can often be found by buying clones or seeds available in pharmacies. Dispensaries have different varieties and types of medical marijuana, and patients may need a staff member to help them with the right type of medical marijuana. 

There are various purchase options, including [medicinal cannabis](https://weedbudbase.com/) at will. Your licensed physician can assist you with any questions you may have, and our competent staff at the Pharm table are at your disposal if you need them.

Choose a state-certified pharmacy that will guide you through its high-quality products. In each of these pharmacies you can be sure that our quality standards are rigorous and trustworthy.

Medical cannabis dispensaries often grant concessions to patients that recreational stores do not. This is evident in Colorado, for example, where medical cannabis patients can avoid the 10% retail tax on marijuana and the 15% excise tax that recreational pharmacy customers have to pay. Medical cards allow patients to access their medicines at a lower cost and make their healthcare more affordable and accessible. 

Registered patients and caregivers may purchase medical CBD products at federally licensed dispensaries. Possession of any amount of cannabis outside a state-licensed CBD is punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine up to $1,000. Iowa also determines the permitted forms of CBD drugs and the CBD / THC ratio. 

The Iowa Legislature passed SF 2360, also known as the Medical Cannabidiol Act, in 2014, which allows licensed neurologists to certify the use of CBD products with a THC content of 3% or less for patients with persistent epilepsy.",Laws Governing Medical Marijuana In The USA,0

2. Weighing the food before and after:

1891,p0484p,nutrition,"I don't know why it took me so many years to figure this out, but now that I have it's quite the eye opener.

One of the reasons why so many people gain too much weight, is because they eat too many high calorie foods that weight the same as low calorie foods.

For example:

1 lb of watermelon weighs the same as 1 lb of chocolate cake. Both of these foods will fill you up the same because they both weigh 1 lb.

But 1 lb of chocolate cake has about 1000 calories. 

1 lb of watermelon has about 140 calories.

So what people need to do, is lower the quantity of high calorie foods they eat and replace it will lower calorie foods that weight the same. This way, they will get just as full, but the meal will be more balanced because they have to go into better food groups in order to get the calories.

It's okay to eat high calorie foods, but the number of calories that you consume from those types of foods should not use up the majority of calories that you should be consuming during an entire day. The calories should be spread out among several food groups, not just one or two.

Once you understand this, you realize that it's okay to have a bacon cheeseburger with fries for lunch, because you know how to use other food groups to get the remaining calories you need for the day.

If you take this principal but convert it over to macros, it's actually way better because not only are you getting the calories right, but you're also eating very balanced meals every day.",One of the reasons people gain too much weight,0

All of this is to my understanding autoimmune problems. A UC doctor told me there's nothing I can do in terms of diet but I refuse to belive that. 

Any recommendations for an elimination diet? Anyone who has tried it to treat autoimmune issues? I basically eat two meals a day. Oat meal with milk (I drink a lot too) and dinner with meat/fish. 

From what I understand you cut out milk, gluten, soy and eggs to begin with then introduce them one by one after 30 days? I can barely think of a single breakfast not containing one of these.

Would greatly appreciate any help.",Elimination diet for multiple autoimmune conditions,0

Impulsively I took 3x my women‚Äôs all in one vitamin supplement(it‚Äôs strong) and at least 3x(dunno exact) my women‚Äôs multivitamin gummies as uh.. I guess to harm myself.

I understand that as far blocking absorption goes, if you aren‚Äôt deficient it probably isn‚Äôt anything to worry about. My main worry is digestive issues. 

I have no problem with the pre-made cups of oatmeal with added nuts as well as some brands that contain 20g of whey but every time I buy a big box of instant oats I get horribly constipated accompanied by moderate to severe cramping. Not sure if the protein oatmeals come pre-soaked or if possibly the larger portions I make of plain oats are to blame.

Anywho getting to my potentially stupid question: Is oat milk full of phytic acid? Have been drinking a large cup or two a day as well as two cups of coffee with unsweetened oat milk based creamer.

1910,ozcjgh,nutrition,"Some very interesting [research](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/articles/201207/eternal-curves) which shows that omega 3 fatty acid DHA is stored around the thighs, glutes and hips of women. These stores are built up over their entire lifetime and gets used up during breast feeding.

The authors connect this with the potential healthier and smarter offspring that these women would have due to the abundance of DHA which would make its way to the children via breastfeeding. This may perhaps explain why men find hourglass figures (low waist to hip ratio) attractive. (No mention of what types of fatty acids are stored in breast fat so maybe some one can comment on this).

It‚Äôs certainly an interesting theory and one that further validates the importance of omega 3 fatty acids in the diet albeit from a evolutionary perspective. It‚Äôs reassuring to see evolutionary research support all the nutritional studies on the benefits of omega 3‚Äôs.

I‚Äôm now really intrigued as to what the fatty acid composition of visceral stomach fat is and if simple dietary changes would help reduce it. 

Supplements are one way of getting omega 3‚Äôs but I genuinely believe food is the best way to obtain all the nutrients that the body needs. Oily fish such as salmon, mackerel and herring are rich sources of DHA.","Omega 3 fatty acid DHA is stored around the buttocks, hips and the thighs in women",0
